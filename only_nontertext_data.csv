Non-terrorist,"In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

Praise be to Allah and Blessing on His messenger, companions and followers

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

I greet you with the Islamic greeting; Peace be upon you and God's mercy and blessings;

It is the will of Allah that I undertake this huge responsibility which Allah has chosen for me and a request from the MB Movement which I respond to with the support of Allah. With the support of my Muslim Brothers I look forward to achieving the great goals, we devoted ourselves to, solely for the sake of Allah.

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

At the outset of my speech I would like to address our teacher, older brother, and distinguished leader Mr. Mohamed Mahdy Akef, the seventh leader of the MB group a strong, dedicated and enthusiastic person who led the group's journey amid storms and surpassed all its obstacles, thus providing this unique and outstanding model to all leaders and senior officials in the government, associations and other parties by fulfilling his promise and handing over the leadership after only one term, words are not enough to express our feelings to this great leader and guide and we can only say ""May Allah reward you all the best"".

We say to our beloved Muslim brothers who are spread around the globe, it is unfortunate for us to have this big event happening while you are not among us for reasons beyond our control, however we feel that your souls are with us sending honest and sincere smiles and vibes.

As for the beloved ones who are behind the bars of tyranny and oppression for no just reason other than reiterating Allah is our God, and for seeking the dignity, pride and development of their country, we sincerely applaud and salute them for their patience, steadfastness and sacrifices which we are sure will not be without gain. We pray that those tyrants and oppressors salvage their conscience and that we see you again in our midst supporting our cause, may Allah bless and protect you all.

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

As you are aware, the main goal of the Muslim Brotherhood Movement (MB) is comprehensive modification, which deals with all kinds of corruption through reform and change. ""I only desire (your) betterment to the best of my power; and my success (in my task) can only come from Allah."" (Hud-88) and through cooperation with all powers of the nation and those with high spirits who are sincere to their religion and nation.

The MB believes that Allah has placed all the foundations necessary for the development and welfare of nations in the great Islam; therefore, Islam is their reference towards reform, which starts from the disciplining and training of the souls of individuals, followed by regulating families and societies by strengthening them, preceded by bringing justice to it and the continuous jihad to liberate the nation from any foreign dominance or intellectual, spiritual, cultural hegemony and economic, political or military colonialism, as well as leading the nation to development, prosperity and assuming its appropriate place in the world.

As a result of this comprehensive understanding of Islam the MB were described as Salafists, Sunni, political organization, sports group, scientific and cultural associations, economic companies and a social idea, as provided in the Quran ""But seek, with the (wealth) which Allah has bestowed on thee, the Home of the Hereafter, nor forget thy portion in this world: but do thou good, as Allah has been good to thee, and seek not (occasions for) mischief in the land: for Allah loves not those who do mischief."" (Al-Qasas, 77)

The Muslim Brothers understand that the Quran and Sunnah include all rules, which may be applied to every aspect of life, and the nation has to choose the best for it. According to these rules, which include many alternatives and jurisdiction, options, may change according to the custom, time and place.

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

Although our ideas, aims and objectives are clear, many people try to define us differently and attribute different goals and objectives to us; therefore, we keep re-introducing ourselves, our principles and our stances to the current affairs.

Initially, I would like to tell those who back the unity of the group that those who sincerely work for their God, religion, and country must be as one unit, despite having different opinions. Those who think that different opinions in the group cause disunity or affect the brotherhood do not fully understand the MB. The MB has all promised Allah to toil for his sake as one unit.

The MB operates according to rules and regulations, which are under continuous review, and development without contradicting the basic principles and the MB with this regard accept the advice and wisdom of all as they follow the aphorism ""God bless those who show me my defects"".

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

I would like to highlight and stress the following points:

We are a group of Muslims and not the Muslim group, since one group cannot monopolize Islam, and praise be to Allah, the MB is extremely popular in all countries of the Arab and Islamic worlds because of its moderate call which stems from the pure Quran and Sunnah.

Our approach and movement are linked and based on each other, the latter is based on the former and our motto is cited in the Quranic verse: ""And those who came after them say: ""Our Lord! Forgive us, and our brethren who came before us into the Faith, and leave not, in our hearts, rancor (or sense of injury) against those who have believed. Our Lord! Thou art indeed Full of Kindness, Most Merciful."" (Al Hashr, 10).

We believe in gradual reform, which can only be achieved through a peaceful, and constitutional struggle based on persuasion and dialogue and definitely not through coercion, hence we reject violence in all its forms by either governments or individuals.

The MB group believes that the ruling system should maintain personal freedoms, consultation (democracy), and to obtain the legitimacy of the authority from the nation, identification of powers and separating between it, is the closest ruling system to Islam and they accept no alternative. From this perspective they participate in political sessions and demand the reformation of the system via the available and peaceful means such as parliamentary and community work which they consider as a duty. They have to fulfill to their understanding of their religion and sincerity to their nations.

With regards to our stance from the Egyptian regime, we emphasize that the MB were never opponents to the regime, even if the regime constantly imposes restrictions on them, confiscates their money and frequently arrest its leaders. However, the MB has never hindered in facing the corrupted policies in all areas and always provides recommendations to get past the continued crisis, which the regime has subjected our country to. They raise the sons and daughters of this nation on virtues, morals and helping others, which all benefits the nation, citizens and the state's institutions.

The MB emphasize that their stances from systems are primarily based on praising the good and opposing the bad, hence they do not oppose anything for the sake of it.

With regards to our Christian brothers in the Arab and Islamic world, our stance is very clear as they are partners and participants in building the civilization of this nation, our colleagues in defending it, partners in its development and dealing and cooperating with them is an Islamic obligation. ""Allah forbids you not, with regard to those who fight you not for (your) Faith nor drive you out of your homes, from dealing kindly and justly with them: for Allah loveth those who are just."" (Al-Momtahena, 8)

The MB believes that citizenship is based on cooperation and full equality in the rights and obligations, except for personal matters, which are according to everyone's faith.

The MB strongly rejects and condemns all kinds of sectarian violence, which is frequent and announces their rejection to all these painful incidents as Christians along with Muslims make one social and cultural community. They also call for frankly discussing the reasons behind this tension and finding solutions to remove all sensitivities to restore the nation as a healthy unit.

With regards to women, the MB has previously illustrated promoting all the rights of women in the economic, social and political field. ""The Believers, men and women, are protectors one of another: they enjoin what is just and forbid what is evil: they observe regular prayers, practice regular charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger"" (Tawbah, 71). We call on all Muslim women to play their role generally and to keep up to date with the current affairs as this benefits our Muslim and Arab nation.

Democracy or (Consulting) is our essential tool, which we strive to adopt and consolidate. All our institutions or associations in the group are based on consulting and democracy beginning from the Boards of People to the office of the Guidance Bureau itself. The MB emphasize that democracy at its core means the non-abolition or cancellation of the other party's opinion and the adopting of the majority's decision.

With regards to Islamic, national powers, political parties, intellectual and cultural elites, the MB believe that everyone should take part in the development and reform and they refuse any exclusion of any individual or association or the marginalizing of any individual's role. They accept the plurality of parties and the freedom for the parties to be established without restrictions as long as it is established within the framework of the Constitution. They believe in the transmission of power between different parties and groups through free and fair elections since the country is for all and its reform is unexceptionally the responsibility of each individual.

The MB prioritizes the Palestinian case and considers it as the most important case for the nation, which measures the standard of loyalty to Islam, and Arabism and they do not spare any efforts to make this cause the first interest of ruling systems and nations until Palestine is free, God willing.

The MB unwaveringly supports the Arab and Islamic nation and supports its fair stances and important issues. They do not hesitate to offer advice to all bodies and Islamic or Arab associations both at the official and public levels and they never stopped sacrificing for the sake of the nation whenever needed.

They transfer the call for unity and cooperation between Arab and Islamic countries to resist the projects of colonialism, western and Zionist hegemony as they call for the unity of the nation and solving the problems within and between Arab and Islamic countries through advocating dialogue and not arms. Here we should remind our brothers in Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Pakistan that the only way to ensure the safety and security of their people would only come by committing to dialogue and agreeing on the best of these dear nations.

Our stance to the global system led by USA and the west is more than clear. We hold no animosity to the western countries, however we are against this global system, which accepts freedom and democracy for its people and denies our people the same. Its use of its economic power to assert its control over our countries and decisions. The Zionist state seeks the abolition and cancellation of our values, cultures and Islamic identity for its western values, which seeks the destruction of our faith and morals in our countries.

We call on the nation to unite in the face of the Zionist and western project and to overcome above all ideological differences, to end racism and to completely refuse and prohibit any assault on or occupation of an Arab or Islamic country league.

We call on these global systems to be just and fair and to work on bringing peace and cooperation between the peoples of the world and to promote the values of freedom and justice around the globe."" All of you are sons of Adam and Adam was created from dust"" (Albarraz) and the verse of the Quran ""O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honored of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things). (Al-Hujurat, 13)

The Arab is not better than the foreigner, and the foreigner is not better than the Arab, the black man is not better than the white man and the white man is not better than the black man, except in piety.

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

We look to the future with hope and concern.

Hope is the motto of true believers and it is the reason we keep working with hope. Love and brotherhood is the method in which MB face hardships and; despair is not in the attitude of believers and idleness is not of the mujahid's qualities.

Our concern includes that of all Egyptians, Arabs and Muslims; the whole humanity shares the same concern over the future of the world, which is threatened by conflicts, epidemics, and diseases and scholars pity it because of the global warming, desertification and drought. Concern is also over the unknown future of the globe led by the policies of the superpowers who desired to solely lead the whole humanity for two decades where they thought they could control the other part of the world. However, they were surprised to see rivers of blood and bodies spread in different parts of the Islamic world including Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan Somalia, Lebanon and Palestine in addition to the economic crises starting one after another with people living in anxiety and concern about their future and the future of their children.

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

Egyptians, Arabs, Muslims and the whole of humanity are expecting and anticipating much from you, and you - God Willing- are capable of taking this responsibility; repeatedly history has recorded your patience, steadfastness, resoluteness and productivity despite the rumours, which are always spread about you.

Offer to the world the real Islam, the Islam of tolerance and moderation, the Islam that respects the pluralism in the world, the Islam of acquaintance and cooperation for the good of the humanity.

Pass through every path and use all means possible to spread the call for Islam between people and strive truly"" Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness, with the (Qur'an)."" (Al-Furqan, 52).

Persist in your struggle through, statements, writings, speeches, songs, decent films and meaningful dramas. Utilize all means to shed light on facts about Islam ending all trepidation. Promote and adhere to your slogan from the Quranic verse "" Invite (all) to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious: for thy Lord knoweth best, who have strayed from His Path, and who receive guidance (Al-Nahl, 126)

And dispute ye not with the People of the Book, except with means better (than mere disputation), unless it be with those of them who inflict wrong (and injury): but say, ""We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; Our Allah and your Allah is one; and it is to Him we bow (in Islam)."" (Al-Ankabut, 46)

Educate yourselves on the fine virtues and ethics, be models for people, guide them to Allah by being a good example with excellent behaviour, and participate with others in the reform of spirits and morals.

Cooperate with everyone working for the good of Islam and oppose all that is dire, continue in supporting the correct, protecting faith and fighting against infidelity.

Correct yourselves and your houses, seek the virtuous, and work to fix your communities, stand by the oppressed everywhere and restore the rights of people.

Turn to the Holy Quran and the honourable Sunnah of the prophet, the life of the honest prophet and lives of other great people, study it and get the best of it and correct your paths always and always be aware that Allah is watching what you do not what is inside you and await the victory from Allah, which is not difficult. ""With the help of Allah. He helps whom He will, and He is exalted in might, most merciful."" (Ar-Rum, 5)

And say: ""Work (righteousness): Soon will Allah observe your work, and His Messenger, and the Believers: Soon will ye be brought back to the knower of what is hidden and what is open: then will He show you the truth of all that ye did."" (Al-Tawbah, 105)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Non-terrorist," I would say we should never ever distinguish or separate, or divorce, politics from ethics. And ethics has to do with religion. The point for me is never to come with religion as a dogmatic understanding, a dogmatic system, and imposing onto politics religion.

This was in fact a concept that came from within the Muslim Brotherhood in the '50s in jail, where a group of people were, was saying, the only true Muslims are us, and Nasser is no longer a Muslim.

The mainstream Muslim Brotherhood movements said no, we are ""Islamiyun"", and we are all Muslims. ""Muslimun"". Meaning that the Islamists have a social project, a political project as different from Muslims who are practicing Muslims and believers. So there is something here which has to do a political vision about the state, but also a vision about the society.

That, that's the very good point. I think that we need a qualification, today, when we speak about Islamist, we don't know what we are talking about because this is what is coming sometimes from the West, and sometimes from secularists in Muslim-majority countries saying you know what at the end they are all the same. They all want what Bin Laden wanted.

That, that's based on nothing but projection and, and nonsense. They have a selective approach towards democracy. If it suits them, that's fine. So the point for me is to put all the Islamists who are saying that they are against democracy, it's completely wrong. In fact, if you look at what is happening in Turkey, 10 years ago, when people were talking about Erdogan, they were saying, he's going to apply Sharia implement Sharia and there will be no democracy. At the end, he's much more democratic and he's much more a democrat than the military, and even some secularist who are ready to use the army against the democratic process.

There are lots of things to do still in Turkey to get a free society, respecting minorities, that's for sure. But if you look at all the other countries, Turkey is much better than many.

I think that from the very beginning I never bought the idea that these were revolutions. if you try to tell me that all what happened on the ground was not known by the West, I don't buy this. This is nonsense. And I said from the very beginning, we are too much focusing on the political equation of what is happening, while the big big question is the economic side of the equation. This has to do with economy and new actors in the region.

What, no. What I'm saying in the book that even Mubarak knew about this mobilisation of cyber-dissidents, and this was known. What I am saying in the book that the only country in which I think it was not expected, paradoxically, was Syria. Because it took eight months, for the US administration to find the people with whom it can work.

Tell me why Google organised the first meeting in Budapest of cyber-dissidents coming from the Middle East two years before...?

I am telling you that this is coming from a support. I don't buy this idea that everything that happened in the Middle East was coming out of nothing. So this is what I'm saying. Now to tell me that I'm patronising the people, no. I think that the people were sincere, and the people were strong. And this is what I still call it, an awakening.

Non-terrorist,"An ideal society should be mobile, should be full of channels for conveying a change taking place in one part to other parts. In an ideal society there should be many interests consciously communicated and shared. There should be varied and free points of contact with other modes of association. In other words there should be social endosmosis. This is fraternity, which is only another name for democracy. Democracy is not merely a form of Government. It is primarily a mode of associated living, of conjoint communicated experience. It is essentially an attitude of respect and reverence towards fellowmen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Non-terrorist,"“The criticism of some people is hard. In their opinion, I was leading my poor helpless untouchable people astray. They say, ‘today those who are Untouchables will remain Untouchables, and those rights gained for the Untouchables will be destroyed’ and some people among us are bewildered. To the unlearned people among us, they say, ‘Go by the traditional path’ [pagdandi (Hindi), ‘footpath’ suggests that the Mahars should use an inferior path]. On some of the old and young among us, they may be influential. If doubt has been created in the minds of people because of this, it is our duty to remove that doubt; and to turn back that doubt is to strengthen the foundation of our movement.

“Earlier we people had had a movement against eating meat. The touchables thought a bolt of lightning had hit them. They should drink living buffalo’s milk; but, when that buffalo died, we should carry that dead cow on our shoulders. Wasn’t this a strange practice? We tell them, if your old woman died, then why not give her to us? If you ought to give us your dead cow, then you ought to give us your old woman also, shouldn’t you? At that time, some man wrote in Kesari that in certain villages every year fifty cattle die, so that five hundred rupees can be earned from their hide, horns, hooves, meat, bones, and tail. Leaving aside the matter of meat, these people will be deprived of all that profit, so the letter appeared in Kesari. Really speaking, what was the necessity of giving an answer to his propaganda? But our people used to feel that if our lord [Babasaheb] does not give an answer to this thing, then what does the lord do at all?

“Once I went to a meeting at Sangamner. An arrangement for eating in the evening after the meeting had been made. At that time a note was sent me by a Kesari reporter, and he asked me, “Say, you tell your people not to remove dead cattle [from the village]! Look at their poverty. No sari and blouse for their wives, no food for them, no fields for them. When their circumstances are so difficult, why do you say, throw away the 500-rupee profit every year from hide, hoof, and meat? Is this not a loss for your people?

“I said: We will answer you. Shall I answer here on the veranda, or in a meeting? It is good if this critical question comes before people. I asked the gentleman, “Is this all you have to say, or is there more?” The gentleman said, “Whatever I have asked you, answer that much.” I asked that man, “How many children and dependents do you have”? He said, “I have five sons and my brother has five or six children also.” I said, “Then your family is large. You and your relations should certainly remove the dead cattle from the village and get that 500-rupee profit. Besides that, every year I myself will give you 500 rupees on top of that. Whatever will become of my people, whether they will get food and clothing or not, this is my affair and I will look after it. But are you putting aside such a successful thing? Why do you not take it on? If we do the work and get the profit, won’t there be a profit if you do it? Why don’t you remove the dead cattle?

“Yesterday a Brahmin boy came to me and asked, “In Parliament and the Assemblies, your people have been given reserved places. Why are you giving those up?” I said to him, “You become a Mahar and fill that place in Parliament and the Assemblies. If there is a service vacant, then that place fills in no time. How many applications from Brahmins and others come for that place! As places in service are filled in that way, why don’t you Brahmin people, as Mahars, fill those reserved seats?

“If we have suffered a loss, why do you weep? This is my question to them. Truly it means honor is dear to mankind; profit is not dear. A woman of good qualities and good behavior knows that there is profit in prostitution. There is a locality of prostitutes in our Bombay. When those women get up at eight in the morning, they order breakfast from a nearby hotel and say (Dr Ambedkar at this time, giving an imitation in a different voice, said): ‘Suleman, you bring a pound of bread and a plate of minced meat.’ That Suleman brings it. Besides, he brings tea, bread, cake, and other things. But my depressed-class sisters do not even get ordinary chutney-bhakri. However, they live with dignity. They live piously.

“We are fighting for honor. We are getting ready to lead mankind to perfection. For this, we are ready to do any sacrifice necessary. These newspaper people (turning toward them) have pestered me for the last forty years. How much criticism have they given me, even up to this day! I say to them, however: Think! Today, leave aside immature speech; use mature speech.

Non-terrorist,"I feel, however good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot. The working of a Constitution does not depend wholly upon the nature of the Constitution. The Constitution can provide only the organs of State such as the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. The factors on which the working of those organs of the State depend are the people and the political parties they will set up as their instruments to carry out their wishes and their politics. Who can say how the people of India and their purposes or will they prefer revolutionary methods of achieving them? If they adopt the revolutionary methods, however good the Constitution may be, it requires no prophet to say that it will fail. It is, therefore, futile to pass any judgement upon the Constitution without reference to the part which the people and their parties are likely to play.

… my mind is so full of the future of our country that I feel I ought to take this occasion to give expression to some of my reflections thereon. On 26th January 1950, India will be an independent country (Cheers). What would happen to her independence? Will she maintain her independence or will she lose it again? This is the first thought that comes to my mind. It is not that India was never an independent country. The point is that she once lost the independence she had. Will she lost it a second time? It is this thought which makes me most anxious for the future. What perturbs me greatly is the fact that not only India has once before lost her independence, but she lost it by the infidelity and treachery of some of her own people. In the invasion of Sind by Mahommed-Bin-Kasim, the military commanders of King Dahar accepted bribes from the agents of Mahommed-Bin-Kasim and refused to fight on the side of their King. It was Jaichand who invited Mahommed Gohri to invade India and fight against Prithvi Raj and promised him the help of himself and the Solanki Kings. When Shivaji was fighting for the liberation of Hindus, the other Maratha noblemen and the Rajput Kings were fighting the battle on the side of Moghul Emperors. When the British were trying to destroy the Sikh Rulers, Gulab Singh, their principal commander sat silent and did not help to save the Sikh Kingdom. In 1857, when a large part of India had declared a war of independence against the British, the Sikhs stood and watched the event as silent spectators.

Indian Republic starts
(Pic courtesy: National Herald)

Will history repeat itself? It is this thought which fills me with anxiety. This anxiety is deepened by the realization of the fact that in addition to our old enemies in the form of castes and creeds we are going to have many political parties with diverse and opposing political creeds. Will Indians place the country above their creed or will they place creed above country? I do not know. But this much is certain that if the parties place creed above country, our independence will be put in jeopardy a second time and probably be lost for ever. This eventuality we must all resolutely guard against. We must be determined to defend our independence with the last drop of our blood.(Cheers)

On the 26th of January 1950, India would be a democratic country in the sense that India from that day would have a government of the people, by the people and for the people. The same thought comes to my mind. What would happen to her democratic Constitution? Will she be able to maintain it or will she lose it again. This is the second thought that comes to my mind and makes me as anxious as the first.

It is not that India did not know what is Democracy. There was a time when India was studded with republics, and even where there were monarchies, they were either elected or limited. They were never absolute. It is not that India did not know Parliaments or Parliamentary Procedure. A study of the Buddhist Bhikshu Sanghas discloses that not only there were Parliaments-for the Sanghas were nothing but Parliaments – but the Sanghas knew and observed all the rules of Parliamentary Procedure known to modern times. They had rules regarding seating arrangements, rules regarding Motions, Resolutions, Quorum, Whip, Counting of Votes, Voting by Ballot, Censure Motion, Regularization, Res Judicata, etc. Although these rules of Parliamentary Procedure were applied by the Buddha to the meetings of the Sanghas, he must have borrowed them from the rules of the Political Assemblies functioning in the country in his time.

This democratic system India lost. Will she lose it a second time? I do not know. But it is quite possible in a country like India – where democracy from its long disuse must be regarded as something quite new – there is danger of democracy giving place to dictatorship. It is quite possible for this new born democracy to retain its form but give place to dictatorship in fact. If there is a landslide, the danger of the second possibility becoming actuality is much greater.

If we wish to maintain democracy not merely in form, but also in fact, what must we do? The first thing in my judgement we must do is to hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives. It means we must abandon the bloody methods of revolution. It means that we must abandon the method of civil disobedience, non-cooperation and satyagraha. When there was no way left for constitutional methods for achieving economic and social objectives, there was a great deal of justification for unconstitutional methods. But where constitutional methods are open, there can be no justification for these unconstitutional methods. These methods are nothing but the Grammar of Anarchy and the sooner they are abandoned, the better for us.

The second thing we must do is to observe the caution which John Stuart Mill has given to all who are interested in the maintenance of democracy, namely, not “to lay their liberties at the feet of even a great man, or to trust him with power which enable him to subvert their institutions”. There is nothing wrong in being grateful to great men who have rendered life-long services to the country. But there are limits to gratefulness. As has been well said by the Irish Patriot Daniel O’Connel, no man can be grateful at the cost of his honour, no woman can be grateful at the cost of her chastity and no nation can be grateful at the cost of its liberty. This caution is far more necessary in the case of India than in the case of any other country. For in India, Bhakti or what may be called the path of devotion or hero-worship, plays a part in its politics unequalled in magnitude by the part it plays in the politics of any other country in the world. Bhakti in religion may be a road to the salvation of the soul. But in politics, Bhakti or hero-worship is a sure road to degradation and to eventual dictatorship.

The third thing we must do is not to be content with mere political democracy. We must make our political democracy a social democracy as well. Political democracy cannot last unless there lies at the base of it social democracy. What does social democracy mean? It means a way of life which recognizes liberty, equality and fraternity as the principles of life. These principles of liberty, equality and fraternity as the principles of life. These principles of liberty, equality and fraternity are not to be treated as separate items in a trinity. They form a union of trinity in the sense that to divorce one from the other is to defeat the very purpose of democracy. Liberty cannot be divorced from equality, equality cannot be divorced from liberty. Nor can liberty and equality be divorced from fraternity. Without equality, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many. Equality without liberty would kill individual initiative. Without fraternity, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many. Equality without liberty would kill individual initiative. Without fraternity, liberty and equality could not become a natural course of things. It would require a constable to enforce them. We must begin by acknowledging the fact that there is complete absence of two things in Indian Society. One of these is equality. On the social plane, we have in India a society based on the principle of graded inequality which we have a society in which there are some who have immense wealth as against many who live in abject poverty. On the 26th of January 1950, we are going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics we will be recognizing the principle of one man one vote and one vote one value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one value. How long shall we continue to live this life of contradictions? How long shall we continue to deny equality in our social and economic life? If we continue to deny it for long, we will do so only by putting our political democracy in peril. We must remove this contradiction at the earliest possible moment or else those who suffer from inequality will blow up the structure of political democracy which is Assembly has to laboriously built up.

The second thing we are wanting in is recognition of the principle of fraternity. what does fraternity mean? Fraternity means a sense of common brotherhood of all Indians-of Indians being one people. It is the principle which gives unity and solidarity to social life. It is a difficult thing to achieve. How difficult it is, can be realized from the story related by James Bryce in his volume on American Commonwealth about the United States of America.

The story is- I propose to recount it in the words of Bryce himself- that-

“Some years ago the American Protestant Episcopal Church was occupied at its triennial Convention in revising its liturgy. It was thought desirable to introduce among the short sentence prayers a prayer for the whole people, and an eminent  New England divine proposed the words `O Lord, bless our nation’. Accepted one afternoon, on the spur of the moment, the sentence was brought up next day for reconsideration, when so many objections were raised by the laity to the word nation’ as importing too definite a recognition of national unity, that it was dropped, and instead there were adopted the words `O Lord, bless these United States.”

There was so little solidarity in the U.S.A. at the time when this incident occurred that the people of America did not think that they were a nation. If the people of the United States could not feel that they were a nation, how difficult it is for Indians to think that they are a nation. I remember the days when politically-minded Indians, resented the expression “the people of India”. They preferred the expression “the Indian nation.” I am of opinion that in believing that we are a nation, we are cherishing a great delusion. How can people divided into several thousands of castes be a nation? The sooner we realize that we are not as yet a nation in the social and psychological sense of the world, the better for us. For then only we shall realize the necessity of becoming a nation and seriously think of ways and means of realizing the goal. The realization of this goal is going to be very difficult – far more difficult than it has been in the United States. The United States has no caste problem. In India there are castes. The castes are anti-national. In the first place because they bring about separation in social life. They are anti-national also because they generate jealousy and antipathy between caste and caste. But we must overcome all these difficulties if we wish to become a nation in reality. For fraternity can be a fact only when there is a nation. Without fraternity equality and liberty will be no deeper than coats of paint.

These are my reflections about the tasks that lie ahead of us. They may not be very pleasant to some. But there can be no gainsaying that political power in this country has too long been the monopoly of a few and the many are only beasts of burden, but also beasts of prey. This monopoly has not merely deprived them of their chance of betterment, it has sapped them of what may be called the significance of life. These down-trodden classes are tired of being governed. They are impatient to govern themselves. This urge for self-realization in the down-trodden classes must no be allowed to devolve into a class struggle or class war. It would lead to a division of the House. That would indeed be a day of disaster. For, as has been well said by Abraham Lincoln, a House divided against itself cannot stand very long. Therefore the sooner room is made for the realization of their aspiration, the better for the few, the better for the country, the better for the maintenance for its independence and the better for the continuance of its democratic structure. This can only be done by the establishment of equality and fraternity in all spheres of life. That is why I have laid so much stresses on them.

  I do not wish to weary the House any further. Independence is no doubt a matter of joy. But let us not forget that this independence has thrown on us great responsibilities. By independence, we have lost the excuse of blaming the British for anything going wrong. If hereafter things go wrong, we will have nobody to blame except ourselves. There is great danger of things going wrong. Times are fast changing. People including our own are being moved by new ideologies. They are getting tired of Government by the people. They are prepared to have Governments for the people and are indifferent whether it is Government of the people and by the people. If we wish to preserve the Constitution in which we have sought to enshrine the principle of Government of the people, for the people and by the people, let us resolve not to be tardy in the recognition of the evils that lie across our path and which induce people to prefer Government for the people to Government by the people, nor to be weak in our initiative to remove them. That is the only way to serve the country. I know of no better.

Non-terrorist,"Kansas City groups come together to work for change and end the violence as homicides now outpace 2020 numbers.

Saturday, March 27, cars, motorcycles, SUVs, trucks, and show cars will begin lining up along Spring Valley Park Road off 29th Street at 2 p.m for the 3rd Kansas City United in Peace Ride and Rally. The rally and entertainment begins at 3 and will continue as riders take off at 3:30 on a route that brings them through the city and back to the park for more entertainment.The free event will continue until 6 p.m. Anyone wanting a more peaceful Kansas City is invited to join the movement and help work toward positive solutions.

“We are working to create a movement of action and hope in the city,” says Bennette Seaman, spokesperson for the Church of Scientology of Kansas City. “Too many people are being killed. In most cases, these senseless deaths begin with a disagreement. As a community, we have to reach out and help others find a better way to resolve their differences. Conflicts should not result in such a tragic end.”

The Kansas City United in Peace Ride and Rally is organized by the Church of Scientology of Kansas City in coordination with United in Peace Foundation, The Way to Happiness Foundation, the KCOGs, PSS, Mo Solar Apps, Mt. Sinai Missionary Baptist Church, Justice & Dignity Center Coalition, One Love, Ground Level Ministries, Happy Foods, Youth Talk Spill the Tea Talk, and local car clubs.


The Peace Ride and Rally unites diverse communities to take action against mounting homicides.
 
The centerpiece of the Peace Ride is The Way to Happiness, the common-sense moral code written by humanitarian L. Ron Hubbard. The booklet promotes positive change and leads the way to a better, more peaceful life.

United in Peace is a multiethnic, multifaith popular movement that unites diverse communities to work together to bring peace to inner cities. Law enforcement and government leaders have recognized and acknowledged a reduction in violence and crime rates in neighborhoods touched by the Peace Rides. In Compton, California, the mayor and city council said, “the presence of the Peace Rides in the City of Compton not only inspired residents to come together in the name of peace, but each ride has also immediately preceded statistical drops in crime.”

The Way to Happiness Foundation is a secular charitable organization, coordinated by the Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE), an organization dedicated to resolving the major societal ills of drugs, crime, illiteracy and immorality. The Church of Scientology and its parishioners proudly sponsor ABLE and its social betterment groups.

For more information on the Peace Rides, watch an episode of Voices for Humanity on the Scientology Network documenting how Minister Tony Muhammad uses these rides to build a peace movement among notorious warring gangs in South Los Angeles.

Non-terrorist,"On the Scientology website, an interactive timeline, 20/21: A Look Behind & A Look Ahead, shows how the Church launched a program of total preparedness even before the pandemic was announced.  

In times of emergency, the Church of Scientology operates on a maxim coined by Scientology Founder L. Ron Hubbard that “an ounce of prevention is worth a ton of cure.”

The Church compiled the most authoritative and effective guidelines for dealing with such an outbreak and distilled them into a series of illustrated booklets written in simple, direct language anyone can understand. Then Volunteer Ministers across the globe carried out an educational campaign to help their communities understand how to stay well.

In Miami, where the Church routinely works closely with the city’s Latin American consulates to provide humanitarian and social betterment programs to their communities, one of the Volunteer Ministers’ first priorities was to reach out to these officials. They disinfected consulates so it would be safe for them to deliver in-person service to their communities. And they presented them with copies of the “Stay Well” booklets in Spanish so consulate staff could make this information available to anyone contacting them for help. The video shows their The Church of Scientology Miami is open and welcomes the community to visit and learn more about how to keep themselves and their families safe. 

Since 1957, the Church has served a growing congregation. Its new home in North Coconut Grove at 2220 S. Dixie Highway was dedicated in April 2017 by Mr. David Miscavige, ecclesiastical leader of the Scientology religion. 

The Miami Church is featured in an episode of Destination Scientology that broadcasts on DIRECTV 320, can be streamed on Scientology.tv, and is available through satellite television, mobile apps and via the Roku, Amazon Fire and Apple TV platforms.interaction with one of the many consulates they assisted.

“This material is very important,” said Miami’s Honduran Consul describing the booklets. “This is a very articulate effort—an effort which has a lot of commitment. And the information was very systematically put together. In times of crisis, a helping hand is really needed.”

Volunteer Ministers also distributed thousands of copies of Stay Well booklets to essential businesses, gas stations, shops and restaurants. They placed booklets in prominent locations in standees that invited customers to take as many as they liked. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Non-terrorist,"They began the afternoon by meeting with an official involved in social services for the town of Gromo in the southern Alps, introducing her to the drug prevention materials of Foundation for a Drug-Free World, which form the backbone of their prevention initiative. 

In their bright green Drug-Free World vests, their message could not be more clear as they trekked up the slopes.

Sponsored by the Church of Scientology Mission of Bergamo, the volunteers are committed to helping their region end drug addiction before it begins with effective drug prevention. 

Foundation for a Drug-Free World is a volunteer-based organization with hundreds of groups internationally, many of them hosted by Churches of Scientology.

The Church is the main sponsor of the program, enabling the Foundation to provide this secular program and materials free of charge to parents, community leaders and drug educators worldwide.

According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and World Health Organization’s International Standards on Drug Prevention, “for every dollar spent on prevention, at least ten can be saved in future health, social and crime costs.”

Non-terrorist,"A report just released found that with lockdowns and stay-at-home orders over the past year, some form of which is still in place in many areas, nearly half the parents surveyed experienced increased stress.

“Parents with young children at home for remote learning have been particularly impacted, with 60 percent reporting their stress has increased,” says the report. “Three-quarters of parents said they craved more emotional support.” The study also found nearly half the mothers of children under 18 experienced worsened mental health.

Is there something that can be done to deal with this kind of anxiety and pressure and restore happiness and calm?

Tools for Life Courses, available free of charge on the Scientology website, address these and related issues.

In the mid-1970s, noting a dramatic downturn in social and cultural norms, L. Ron Hubbard had a handbook compiled from his research and writings to help people cope with increased stress and challenges. Tools for Life Courses are based on the 19 chapters of this handbook.

With people searching for solutions to issues worsened by the pandemic, interest in the courses skyrocketed, with an average of 4,000 new courses begun each week. The courses all emphasize application. They contain simple but powerful technology that is easy to learn and use.

One of the courses focuses on raising happy, self-reliant children. Two deal with overcoming anxiety, stress and depression. Yet another takes up helping someone overcome drug and alcohol problems, which increased dramatically over the past year.

Last year, concerned that this practice might be sidelined with the media reporting the first COVID-19 cases in the country, the Volunteer Ministers decided to take it on as a tradition of their own. A year later, cases and hospitalizations are surging in the country, so the volunteers took off from the Church of Scientology March 8 with their arms filled with irises that were destined to create 1,000 smiles.

The Scientology Volunteer Ministers of Hungary are headquartered at the Church of Scientology Budapest, whose new home was dedicated in 2016 by Mr. David Miscavige, ecclesiastical leader of the Scientology religion.

The Church of Scientology Volunteer Ministers program is a religious social service created in the mid-1970s by Scientology Founder L. Ron Hubbard.

A Volunteer Minister’s mandate is to be “a person who helps his fellow man on a volunteer basis by restoring purpose, truth and spiritual values to the lives of others.” Their creed: “A Volunteer Minister does not shut his eyes to the pain, evil and injustice of existence. Rather, he is trained to handle these things and help others achieve relief from them and new personal strength as well.”

The Scientology religion was founded by author and philosopher L. Ron Hubbard. The first Church of Scientology was formed in Los Angeles in 1954 and the religion has expanded to more than 11,000 Churches, Missions and affiliated groups, with millions of members in 167 countries.

Non-terrorist,"One message of The Way to Happiness is that you can influence others for the better or the worse—don’t discount the impact your actions have on others.

The Way to Happiness is a moral code based wholly on common sense. Written by author and humanitarian L. Ron Hubbard, its purpose is to help arrest the current moral decline in society and restore integrity and trust to humankind.

The first chapter of the booklet points out: “You are important to other people. You are listened to. You can influence others.”

No matter a city’s attractions, how dynamic its history, how beautiful its boulevards and greenspaces, it is debased if its streets, landmarks and parks are strewn with cigarette butts, bottles, candy wrappers, syringes and discarded furniture or automobile parts.

Not only can neighborhood cleanups address the immediate problem, but by setting a good example they can help rebuild pride, participation and responsibility that can be felt in other aspects of community life.

The Way to Happiness can restore honesty and self-respect on a grass-roots level, worldwide, by individuals sharing the booklet with others and so bringing about increased tolerance and understanding among families, friends, groups, communities, nations and humankind—making a safer, less violent world for all. The booklet has been distributed in 117 languages in 186 nations and territories.

A free online E-course in 17 languages covering each of the 21 precepts is available through The Way to Happiness website, which includes the text of the booklet, the feature-length The Way to Happiness book-on-film and 21 public service announcements illustrating each of the booklet’s precepts.

Churches of Scientology and Scientologists are proud to support The Way to Happiness, and sponsor local chapters of The Way to Happiness Foundation to help instill a higher level of honesty, trust and self-respect.

On their last trip in early February, when they helped reopen a local school that was destroyed by the temblor, they surveyed those affected by the disaster for what they need to rebuild. The Scientology community in Torino, Milano and Pordenone helped raise the donations and another team of Volunteer Ministers took off from Rome to take part in the latest relief effort. 

Their bright yellow Volunteer Ministers vans were joined by the white van of Grantorto, a town near the Church of Scientology Padova, whose mayor decided to take part in their venture after they briefed him on the destruction caused by the earthquake and the hardship it caused the people of the town of Glina.

The Church of Scientology Volunteer Ministers program is a religious social service created in the mid-1970s by Scientology Founder L. Ron Hubbard. It constitutes one of the world’s largest independent relief forces.

With the events of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York City, Scientology ecclesiastical leader Mr. David Miscavige called on Scientologists to redouble their efforts to aid their fellow man. He issued a directive entitled “The Wake-Up Call,” which inspired astonishing growth within the Volunteer Minister program.

The following year, Volunteer Ministers of Italy formed Pro.Civi.Co.S, which was entered into the registry of the National Department of Civil Defense.

Pro.Civi.Co.S responded to Italy’s L’Aquila and Amitrice earthquakes, the Haiti earthquake in 2010 and the South Asia tsunami in Indonesia in 2005.

A Volunteer Minister’s mandate is to be “a person who helps his fellow man on a volunteer basis by restoring purpose, truth and spiritual values to the lives of others.” Their creed: “A Volunteer Minister does not shut his eyes to the pain, evil and injustice of existence.

In times of stress, people depend on their churches for guidance and solace, but fear of contagion was keeping people from availing themselves of these services. Orlando Volunteer Ministers took on the sanitization of nearby churches and provided them with copies of educational booklets that make it easy to understand how to keep yourself and your family safe and well.

As the pastor of the Way to Calvary Church of the Nazarene put it in a video on the Scientology website’s interactive timeline, 20/21: A Look Back & A Look Ahead, the Scientologists were on the front lines. “You clean our building so we can be safe,” he said.  He took copies of the booklets so he could share this information with his congregation.

“Not everyone would take time to do what you are doing,” said the pastor of the First Haitian Baptist Church of Central Florida. “This is a great, mighty ministry.”

The pastor of the Apostolic Church of God of Orlando said the booklets were worth a million dollars to him. “The Scientology Ministry is doing this—this benefits everybody,” he said.

The Church of Scientology hosted the back-to-school drive-thru in August to provide Orlando families, out of work because of restrictions, with school supplies and food.
 
With schools about to open last August, Volunteer Ministers partnered with community groups to provide families with food and supplies. The president of the Boricuas de Corazon Foundation described how the Volunteer Ministers began working with her last March and came every single day. “They don’t miss one day,” she says. “They go with us in the warehouse, they do all the sorting, all the packing.” 

One of the projects the Church did with this foundation was a back-to-school drive-thru held at the Church. Families began arriving at 11 in the morning and continued to 5:30 p.m. School supplies, hygiene and sanitation products, and food were placed directly into the trunks of their cars to avoid any violations of social distancing.

“We’re out here making a difference for the people,” said the Sheriff of Osceola County at the drive-thru, “great people who just need that hand up… You guys are tremendous and great in my eyes.”

The Church of Scientology Orlando was dedicated in May 2018 by Mr. David Miscavige, ecclesiastical leader of the Scientology religion.

Non-terrorist,"It’s great to be here today, among so many friends, and I appreciate your warm welcome. As you might imagine, I don’t get invited to many parties in this town. That’s okay. I came to Washington when I was about your age, but I didn’t come here to be popular. I came here to stand for what I believe is true.

The political elites may not like it. The liberal media can keep hating on me. But I’m still standing, unapologetic and unflinching in defense of our individual freedom. They can call me crazy and whatever else they want, but NRA’s nearly 5 million members and America’s 100 million gun owners will not back down — not now, not ever.

The Second Amendment is not just words on parchment. It’s not some frivolous suggestion from our Founding Fathers to be interpreted by whim. It lies at the heart of what this country was founded upon. Our Founding Fathers knew that without Second Amendment freedom, all of our freedoms could be in jeopardy.

Our individual liberty is the very essence of America. It is what makes America unique. If you aren’t free to protect yourself — when government puts its thumb on that freedom — then you aren’t free at all.

But they insult, denigrate and call us crazy for holding fast to that belief. In their distorted view of the world, they are smarter than we are. They are special and more worthy than we are. They know better than we do and if we dare disagree, they scorn us, demonize us and try to shut us up. We will not be demonized, we will not be silent.

It’s time for a sane look at the insanity that has consumed all too much of the media and the political class in this town. They wag a condemning finger at the NRA. They call US crazy. But no one — no other organization in the world — has spent more millions, over more decades, to keep Americans safe. Our firearms safety training, law enforcement training, women’s training, hunter education and child accident prevention programs are second to none.

While gun ownership is at an all-time high, we’ve brought accidents with firearms to an all-time low. Every year, we teach millions of lawabiding people how to use, store and defend themselves with firearms.

We’ve been training America’s military and law enforcement officers since NRA’s founding, way back in 1871.

And they call us crazy? They say we’re the problem? In December, I advocated nothing more than surrounding our schoolchildren with the same level of protection as our jewelry stores and sports stadiums — armed protection. The vast majority of Americans agree and favor a trained, armed police or security officer in every school. In a survey of all 50 states, nearly 90 percent of teachers and administrators said an armed officer would make their schools safer.

There isn’t a mom or a dad anywhere who wouldn’t feel better seeing a police car in the parking lot when they drop their kids off at school.

But the powerful elites, who will always have their own security, called our proposal absurd.

You know what’s really absurd? Not protecting our children at school.

Thousands of our schools today remain as vulnerable as ever to the evil intentions of a madman. While Janet Napolitano’s Department of Homeland Security offers this from its website:

“If you are caught out in the open and cannot conceal yourself or take cover, you might consider trying to overpower the shooter with whatever means are available,” a narrator says, while the video shows an office worker pulling a pair of scissors out of a drawer.

Scissors? That’s their answer?

Let’s get this straight. To protect our children at school, we recommend a trained professional with a gun. They recommend scissors. And they say we’re crazy? That’s sheer madness.

Here’s what the political elites offer instead — a placebo called “universal” background checks. Yep, that’s their big idea.

A background check. A check that will always be far from universal, will never make our schools or streets safer, and will only serve as universal registration of lawful gun owners — the real goal they’ve been pushing for decades.

Criminals won’t participate and the records of the mentally ill will never ever be part of the check. With all the HIPAA laws and patient privacy issues, the monsters of Tucson, Aurora, Newtown — those names will never be in the system. And those killers really are crazy!

The very advocates and politicians behind this new universal scheme have fought — behind the scenes, for two decades — to prevent mental health records from being added to the check system. Their check only includes good, law-abiding people like you and me. That’s what they’re after — the names of good, decent people who happen to own a firearm to go into a federal database for universal registration of every lawful gun owner in America.

That’s their answer to criminal violence? Criminalize 100 million law-abiding gun owners in a private transfer? Build a list of good people? As if that would somehow make us safer from violent criminals and homicidal maniacs? That’s their answer? Are they insane?

What’s the point of registering lawful gun owners anyway? So newspapers can print those names and addresses for criminals and gangs to access? So that list can be hacked by foreign entities like the Chinese, who recently hacked Pentagon computers? So that list can be handed over to the Mexican government that, oh by the way, has already requested it.

In the end, there are only two reasons for government to create that federal registry of gun owners — to tax them and to take them.

No gun owner, no rational thinking American, believes that will have any effect on violent criminals and they’re right. It won’t make anyone safer anywhere.

It is troubling and saddening how quickly this debate has deteriorated from what would truly help make people safer to what has proven to be the decades-old agenda of those bent on destroying the Second Amendment. They’ve offered nothing new, nothing helpful in making our schools, our streets, or one child safer.

Senator Dianne Feinstein admitted that she had her gun ban bill ready to go A YEAR AGO, tucked away in a drawer, just waiting for the right opportunity. Really? Waiting for unspeakable tragedy to push her political agenda? And they wonder why most Americans don’t trust Congress.

They are simply not serious about making our kids or our country safer. If they were serious, they’d arrest, prosecute and imprison felons with guns, gangs with guns and drug dealers with guns — as many as they can find. But they don’t do that. They let them go free.

Let’s talk about this thing call sequestration. Now, I run the NRA, not an economic think-tank. But I watch the news and I see that, instead of rational belt-tightening, the first thing the government thinks to do, according to law enforcement officials, is let thousands of criminal illegals out of jail.

Normal people think that’s crazy. It’s as if sanity, itself, has been sequestered in Washington.

We have all these gun laws, with stiff prison time, except the entire criminal justice system says, “We’re not going to do that.”

If federal prosecutors say “just kidding,” normal, law-abiding people say that’s crazy.

And nowhere does that apply more than in Chicago. Federal firearms prosecutions for 2012 dropped by almost 30 percent from their peak in 2004. Federal firearms prosecutions in Chicago dropped 45 percent from 2010 to 2012. President Obama’s hometown ranks dead last in firearms prosecutions — 90th out of 90 federal jurisdictions.

Out of 76,000 prohibited persons flagged by the instant check system, only 13 — 13 — were successfully prosecuted nationwide. Vice President Biden said they don’t have time to prosecute those people.

Excuse me? Don’t have time to prosecute prohibited people trying to illegally get a gun?

The vice president does have time, though, to offer advice to women threatened by an intruder. I’m going to quote him directly.

“Just walk out … walk out and put that double-barrel shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house.”

The vice president of the United States actually told women facing an attack to just empty their shotguns into the air. Honestly, have they lost their minds over at the White House? No doubt violent predators would love to face a woman armed with a shotgun that’s empty.

Well, Mr. Vice President, for four decades you’ve enjoyed the armed protection of Capitol Police and Secret Service officers, all while trying to destroy the Second Amendment rights of the rest of us. When it comes to that right, sir, you keep your advice — we’ll keep our guns.

I see a lot of young women here today. Here’s some more advice from political elites who know what’s best for you:Some members of the Colorado State Legislature think women are too emotional to deal with a violent attack. Senator Jessie Ulibarri said that, instead of using a firearm, you would be better off using “ballpoint pens” to stab an attacker when he stops to reload.

A ballpoint pen?

At the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, officials recommend that women defend themselves against a rapist with quote, “passive resistance.”

Passive resistance? The one thing a violent rapist deserves to face is a good woman with a gun!

They call me crazy, yet the people doing the finger-pointing are saying things that are absolutely bizarre.

I can’t help but think that, as Americans, we all want the same thing. We know our mental health system is in shambles. We all want it fixed.

We want criminals with guns prosecuted and incarcerated. We want the federal gun laws on the books right now enforced against felons with guns, drug dealers with guns, and gangs with guns. If they’d just do that, those violent criminals wouldn’t be on their way to the next crime. They’d be in prison.

We want our children to be safe and protected. That’s why we proposed trained police and security officers in every school.

There’s not a mom or dad in America who wants to leave their children unprotected.

If the Washington elites really wanted the same thing, they would stop demonizing law-abiding gun owners. They would stop trying to convince the American people that all gun owners are potential criminals in waiting. And they would actually implement programs that addressed our problems in a real and meaningful way.

Put police and trained armed security in every school. Enforce the federal gun laws on the books right now. Interdict and incarcerate violent criminals before they get to the next crime scene. Rebuild our broken mental health system. Help the mentally ill by getting them off our streets and into treatment. And for God’s sake,leave the rest of us alone!

The political class and media class just don’t get it. In a lot of ways, they’ve lost track of what this great nation is supposed to be about.

It’s supposed to be about US and people like us, all over this country.

It’s always been about “we the people,” not the political class, all the way back to our founding.

Here’s what I’m talking about.

[Roll Video]


We are the people. This is our country.

This is a fight for our freedom, the freedom that separates us from every other nation on earth. That freedom makes us stronger than other countries. It makes us better than other countries.

That freedom is on the line, now and in 2014 and 2016 and in every election and every political fight in your lifetime. That is what Standing and Fighting and defending freedom is all about.

When I first came to Washington so many years ago, I wanted to make a difference, to stand for something.

This is not an easy place to remain true to your principles. It’s easy to want to be liked and praised here. It’s easy to be swept up in the warped reality that, all too often, is this town.

You are here because you want to make your own difference, take your own stand. Plant your feet firmly in the foundation of freedom, don’t be swayed by the winds of political insanity, and no matter what, let the elitists who scorn you be damned.

Fill your heart with pride. Clear your eyes with conviction. This is your time to Stand and Fight — now and in the next election and the one after that. Now and for the rest of your life. Always stand and always fight for freedom!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Non-terrorist,"I was a very politically active teenager and I'm on this stage as a result of that. Think of how far you all could go, as a result of voicing your beliefs.

Now, I want to answer your question. And, I want to be allowed the opportunity, which is why I am here. To talk and have this discussion with you all and answer these questions. This is why I came down here.

I don't believe that this insane monster should have ever been able to obtain a firearm, ever. I do not think that he should have gotten his hands on any kind of weapon. That's number one.

This individual was nuts and I, nor the millions of people that I represent as a part of this organization, that I'm here speaking for, none of us support people who are crazy, who are a danger to themselves, who are a danger to others, getting their hands on a firearm.

And, we have been, for over 20 years, and I have been screaming about this, which is why I'm here, because I have kids and I'm not just fighting for my kids, I'm fighting for you, I'm fighting for you, I'm fighting for all of you.

Because I don't want anyone to ever be in this position again. I want everyone to think about this for one second, and this goes right into your question. Do you know that it is not federally required for states to actually report people who are prohibited possessors, crazy people, people who are murderers?

No, we've been actually talking about that for a long time. (AUDIENCE JEERS) Let me answer the question. Let me answer the question. You can shout me down when I'm finished, but let me answer Emma's question. It is not federal law for states to report convictions to the NICS system. It's not federally mandated. That's the big question and I wish that this network had also covered this more, as other media networks would have covered it. That's a huge— wait a second, wait a second...

Wait a second! Do you guys want to stop mentally insane individuals from getting firearms. Yes? They have to be in this system. If they are convicted. You can convict them, you can adjudicate the mentally unfit. If a state does not report it to the National Crime Information Center, when you run that form, this individual— this madman passed a background check.

How was he able to pass a background check? He was able to pass a background check because we have a system that's flawed. The Southerland Springs murderer was able to pass a background check because the Air Force did not report that record.

I'm talking for them. These are the 5 million members that I'm here representing. That is what that group's position has been on that. So that answers your question, and they spoke about that before the president made a move and they spoke about that before Attorney General Jeff Sessions made an announcement about that, too. So, that answers your question with that.

Non-terrorist,"Dear and respected friends,

Allow me to start my speech by greeting you. By this act I commit an offense for which Afghan women under the domination of Islamic fundamentalists imposing Sharia law in Afghanistan are severely punished because they do not have the right to greet or express themselves where male strangers are present. As a symbolic act of defiance I would like to heartily shake hands with each and every one of you because fundamentalist edicts say women should absolutely not do so. To this forum where we talk of women's revolution as one of the most vital task of the moment, I convey to you the greetings and regards of Afghan women who are deprived of their most basic human rights and are unfortunately the most forgotten women in the world.

In various epochs of history, mankind has been witness to revolutions which have changed and shaped world outlook. It is difficult to recall a revolution carried out by men alone. History has on record great and glorious deeds of women who played significant roles.

Let's look at French history. The name of Jean d'Arc as the leader of national resistance against English domination, Marie Paule Parant and Leberte Rose Barreau as key players in the French Revolution stand forth boldly from its pages. Along with men, women and children too laid down their lives on that path. It is not irrelevant that Lenin, the leader of the Russian Revolution, wrote: ""What a formidable nation it would be if the France population were only composed of women!""

During the Industrial Revolution in Europe women had remarkable involvement in organizing rallies and strikes and establishing unions. In Russia, women's struggles were outstanding: from mass strike to establishment of various unions up to keeping the revolutionary spirit alive and vibrant, all were closely associated with the participation of women. Women throughout the ages have participated in armed and unarmed struggles against aggression and tyranny. The memory of heroic women such as Clara Zetkin, Roza Luxemburg, Kolontai and Jamila Bopasha are beacons of inspiration for us.

Like us, the brave women of Iran are also struggling against religious fascism. It would be hard to find any country with so many women prisoners as there are in Iran.

It is difficult for me not to continue to remember and talk about heroic and inspiring women and their achievements and contribution to revolutionary changes in the world, but it would be better for me to draw your attention to the other side of the reality of women's lives and works, namely the inferno of the counter-revolution which engulfs every rebellion and burns women in particular in its flaming hell.

Dear friends,

I come from Afghanistan, from a land under the domination of the most brutal and felonious group of ignorant religious fascists. Our land is in the grip of medieval savages whose ominous acts have no parallel in the modern history of any country in the world. If Algerian religious fanatics cut the throats of their child-victims, Afghan religious fanatics first rape their victims and then loot all they have. I come from a land where the depth of the tragedy of Afghan women is not only that the eyes and ears and mouths and tongues of Afghan women are stitched up under the guise of Islamic hejab (veils) or that they are prevented from going to public bathhouses or going to the dressmaker's, the tragedy lies in the fact that in the vast cemetery named Afghanistan the sick mentality of the ""masters"" of the country is such that neither the rape of nine-year-old girls or of seventy-year-old grandmothers are considered to be too revolting or too shameful. Systematic degrading humiliation and public floggings of women innocent of any crime are everyday events; destitution and starvation continually turn respectable mothers and daughters in to beggars and prostitutes.

Since the domination of Jahadis and Taliban, our country is constantly burning in the grief of thousands killed, cities destroyed, and untold atrocities committed together with looting and the fomenting of racial and ethnic hatreds. In the midst of all this, nearly no voice or hand has reached out to them with a comforting touch.

While the rest of the worlds is set to welcome the twenty-first century, in Afghanistan television, music, film, theater, sport - in the short all manifestations of modern civilized life- are being stamped out by the Taliban. While in other parts of the world women's movements are making significant gains worldwide, our women are deprived of the most elementary human rights. Indeed, they are bought and sold like cattle, humiliated, whipped, beaten, restricted in the their movements, and are considered to have little worth other than satisfying male sexual needs and bearing children. Fascistic restrictions, starvation, scarcity of foodstuffs and basic needs, homelessness, unemployment, war and destruction- all gifts from Taliban and Jihadis- have so darkened the lives of our people and specially women folk that large numbers have turned to beggary, prostitution and suicide. It is a measure of the depth of the tragedy created by the fundamentalists that many desperate mothers and fathers have, out of poverty and necessity, been reduced to selling their children.

It is all the more painful that some ascribe such savagery to the traditions and culture and even the wishes of the Afghan people. Such apologists thus want to hide the real face of Islamic fundamentalists but forget that our traditions and culture have never been so inhuman and anti-women.

Tradition cannot and must not be regarded as something sacred. Many inhuman traditions and customs have been done away with throughout historical development. What goes on in Afghanistan -and termed ""Afghan culture"" by apologists of fundamentalist savagery- are inhuman practices stemming from imposed ignorance. RAWA has never given in to such ""traditions"" and has always struggled to the best of its ability to have them rooted out in the shortest possible time. RAWA strongly believes that selling girls and treating women like livestock and having no respect for their rights as human beings and as women are traditions that need to perish and be done away with for ever. If it is true that our world has become a ""small village"" then should the ""villagers"" allow offensive and inhuman ""traditions"" to defile their ""small village""? Why would the ""villagers"" keep silent and not get actively involved when they see that in a part of the ""village"" a handful of people are committing crimes under the name of religion and traditions? If criminals of war in this or that country are brought to trial why not the Afghan Jihadis and Taliban who have committed and continue to commit the most brutal crimes imaginable?

The only hope that our people look to in this atmosphere of oppressive darkness is the flame of struggle for eliminating fundamentalism and achieving freedom and democracy. Like heroic Afghan women such as Malalai, Nahid and Wajiha who sacrificed their lives for the cause of freedom, the very existence and staunch struggles of RAWA as the only feminist political organization is a witness of the undeniable fact that women in Afghanistan have never bowed down to the inhuman treatment of fundamentalists but have fought back in the most bloody and suffocating conditions for achieving their rights. RAWA is enormously proud of its banner which has been stained red by the blood of its founder, Meena, and which has become an inspiration for all freedom-loving women.

The UN and all countries, organizations and individuals advocating freedom and human rights need to come forward to support in words and deeds the Afghan democratic forces including and especially RAWA as the ONLY feminist organization fighting against the fundamentalists and for democracy and women's rights. Instead of imposing sanctions which will hurt our already devastated people, the US and UN must impose real and severe sanctions against all those countries which arm and fund the Taliban and their rivals.

We are of the opinion that speaking out and struggling for human rights, freedom and democracy is the greatest revolutionary task. Despite being a small organization, RAWA could not have been able to continue its activities if it were not supported by the masses of women. But we feel stronger with the practical support we receive from our revolutionary sisters, and we are strengthened in our resolve to firmly oppose and struggle against all forms and manifestations of religious fundamentalism, be it Islamic, Christian, Jewish or any other religion and irrespective of whether it is in Afghanistan or Iran or Sudan or any other corner of the world.

Dear friends,

As we enter the new millennium, in many countries counter-revolution has taken the form of inhuman religious fanaticism, particularly the Islamic type which is threatening global peace and security and is committing the most savage violations of human rights. Religious fundamentalism, particularly Islamic fundamentalism, is the greatest barrier in the way of women's equal rights movements. We can respond to this terrorism and savagery only by establishing a world wide anti-fundamentalist front, and immensely increasing pressure on those who in any way nourish and arm such elements.

We express our solidarity with all the pro-freedom movements in Iran, Kurdistan, Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, East Timor and Latin American and African countries. We wish to cooperate with all pro-democracy organizations but it is a fact that defending and supporting the revolution should not be confined only to speeches in functions and conferences. Practical steps have to be taken in support of revolutionaries of the entire world. We can be faithful to revolutionary aims by not allowing the claws of fundamentalists to tear into the throats of the oppressed masses in various parts of the globe. Revolutionary entities, particularly women's entities, must prove their revolutionary credentials by practical and meaningful cooperation and support to the democratic forces of Afghanistan including RAWA.

Let us hope and work for the emancipation of Afghan women from the clutches of religious fundamentalist fascism. Let us hope and work for a more vociferous voice of protest of the whole pro-democracy community of women and men.

Let the fundamentalist and their foreign masters be terrified by the solidarity of revolutionary women of the world with RAWA.

Thank you.

Non-terrorist,"The US invaded Afghanistan to fulfil its geo-political, economic and regional strategic interests and to change Afghanistan into a strong military base in the region. Since Afghanistan is the heart of Asia, it would serve as a strong base for controlling surrounding countries like Pakistan, China, Iran and above all the Central Asian Republics. Additionally, as a superpower, it continues to occupy Afghanistan to combat rising powers like Russia and China, who are becoming greater rivals for the US in the economic, military and political fields.

Many argue today that the 2001 invasion was planned before 9/11, but it gave the war-mongers in the White House and Pentagon a golden opportunity to advance its agenda in the region. In the words of Tony Blair ""to be truthful about it, there was no way we could have got the public consent to have suddenly launched a campaign on Afghanistan but for what happened on September 11...""

Getting hold of the multi-billions drug business was another reason for invading Afghanistan and in the past few years we clearly see that the US and its allies changed Afghanistan into the opium capital of the world. Opium production increased more than 4400%, with 93% of world illegal opium produced in Afghanistan. Narcotics is said to be the third greatest trade commodity in cash terms after oil and weapons. There are large financial institutions behind this business and the control of the routes of narcotics was important for the US government and now they have reached their goal.

Considering Obama's plans for Afghanistan, we can clearly see that there is no difference between Obama and Bush for our country. Both are following a wrong and devastating strategy which has so far pushed Afghanistan and the region towards disaster and deeper conflicts.
Mariam Rawi
Furthermore, Afghanistan holds a rich source of gas, copper, iron and other minerals and precious stones and the big powers are of course interested in looting it the way they are doing in poor African countries. In the past few years there have been exploration efforts of our natural resources. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates there are about 700 billion cubic meters of gas and 300 million tonnes of oil across several Northern provinces of Afghanistan. Also the world's second-biggest unexploited copper deposit is located in our country with an estimated 11 million tonnes of copper. So besides routing the oil and gas from the Central Asian Republics through Afghanistan, the US is interested in exploiting Afghanistan's resources too.

The ""war on terror"" and ""liberation of Afghan women"" were mere lies to cover the above and many other hidden agendas of the US in Afghanistan. Our peoples' dreams for liberation were shattered in the very first days after the invasion when they witnessed that the war criminals and Northern Alliance murderers and rapists who destroyed Afghanistan, were backed and brought back to power by the US and its allies after the fall of the Taliban regime. When infamous criminals like Burhanuddin Rabbani, Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, Karim Khalili, Mohammad Mohaqiq, Yunus Qanooni, Mullah Rakiti, Atta Muhammad, Rashid Dostum, Ismail Khan, Haji Almas, Hazrat Ali and many more were decorated by the US as champions of freedom and were installed in power, everyone knew that Afghanistan had once again become the centre of a chess game of the US and its allies who made the slogans of ""democracy"" and ""human rights"" into painful jokes for our nation.

Despite many a hue and cry about ""women's rights"" and the ""liberation of Afghan women"", Afghanistan still faces a women's rights catastrophe.

There is no tangible change in the conditions of Afghan women; in certain parts of the country the life is worse than under the Taliban. The rate of kidnappings, rapes, selling of girls, forced marriages, acid attacks, prostitution and self-immolation by young girls and women has reached a record high, even compared to the Taliban regime.

Due to forced marriages and domestic violence, self-immolation by women aged between 18 and 35 is becoming an epidemic in Afghanistan. There have been hundreds of such cases reported mostly in the provinces of Herat, Farah, Ghor and Badghis. Where there is non-existent rule of law and legal support for women, they have no other option but to get rid of their misery by burning themselves.

Due to severe poverty which affects over 80 percent of Afghanistan's population, life for hundreds of thousands of war widows and poor women is disastrous and in many parts of Afghanistan the level of prostitution and begging in the streets has risen to an unprecedented level. There have been many reports of parents being forced to sell their children as they can't feed them. In the western province alone 150 cases of the selling of children, especially girls, were officially reported in 2008 -- the actual numbers are much higher. of Herat

There are many more that are not reflected in the news as the media is strongly stifled under the shadow of guns and threats of the warlords.

In the past few years only some cosmetic changes were made in regard to women's rights. For example, the Women's Ministry and 68 women members of parliament was trumpeted as a big success. Meanwhile the Ministry has done nothing for women and is just a showcase. The majority of women in the parliament are pro-warlord and cannot represent Afghan women as they themselves are part of the problem.

Afghan women have been badly betrayed in the past seven years under the US occupation. Their plight was used to justify the occupation of Afghanistan, but not only were no steps taken to heal their wounds, rather the worst enemies of women's rights were empowered, supported and installed in key posts.

When the entire nation lives under the shadow of warlords, Taliban, drug-lords, occupation forces and a corrupt, puppet and mafia government, how can its women enjoy the most basic rights?

Considering Obama's plans for Afghanistan, we can clearly see that there is no difference between Obama and Bush for our country. Both are following a wrong and devastating strategy which has so far pushed Afghanistan and the region towards disaster and deeper conflicts.

Even if the US deployed hundreds of thousands of troops in Afghanistan, they will not be here to bring ""peace"", ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" for the people of Afghanistan. They will only serve the US's regional interests and help the warlords, drug-lords and other US agents who are in power in our country; but for our suffering and war-stricken people, it will have a ruinous outcome.

Freedom, democracy and justice cannot be enforced at gunpoint by a foreign country; they are the values that can be achieved only by our people and democracy-loving forces through a hard, decisive and long struggle. Those who claim to donate these values to Afghan people through force will only push our country to slavery.

The very first outcome of the ""surge"" for Afghan people will be an increase in the number of civilian casualties which have already sparked protests and opposition from Afghan people. In the past seven years thousands of innocent people have been killed or wounded by the US/NATO bombardments. In the past few weeks under Obama's rule, around 100 Afghan civilians have been killed.

Today many people in Afghanistan ask for the withdrawal of troops and regard them as useless to do any good for Afghanistan. The surge in troops will result in a surge in protests against the US/NATO in Afghanistan and it will also push more people towards the Taliban and other terrorist groups as a reaction to occupation forces and their mistreatment of people.

The troop surge will also give reasons for the insurgency to increase their operations and attacks which in return will intensify the conflict in Afghanistan.

We think the 30,000 extra troops will only serve the US regional strategy in changing Afghanistan into its military base -- it will do nothing to the fight with terrorist groups as they claim. The US and allies are playing a two-faced game in Afghanistan: on the one hand they are increasing troops, and on the other hand, they are supporting the fundamentalist terrorists of the Northern Alliance, and initiating talks with the Taliban and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to share power with these brutal and criminal forces.

So now it is an open secret that the US is not interested in fighting terrorists. In fact no one can believe that a superpower is really incapable of defeating a small, medieval-minded and ignorant force such as the Taliban. Actually the US government needs an excuse to stay in Afghanistan for longer, so the presence of the Taliban and other terrorist groups give them an excuse for the Tom and Jerry game to continue for years -- the UK have already announced that it will stay in Afghanistan for over three decades.

There are even some suspicions that the foreign troops provide some supplies and arms to the Taliban. Last March the Afghan media and local authorities in Arghandab district of Zabul province reported that NATO helicopters dropped three large containers full of supplies and ammunitions to a Taliban commander. In another move, a Taliban criminal commander named Mullah Abdul Salam, responsible for a massacre in 1998, was appointed as the governor of Musa Qala district in the Helmand province, the world's largest opium poppy growing region.

A few months ago, an infamous terrorist from Gubuddin Hekmatyar's party called Ghairat Baheer was released from the US prison at Bagram airbase. Recently media reports uncovered that he is engaged in secret talks to pave the way for a sharing of power with Hekmatyar who is on the US's terrorist list. According to information revealed to Al Jazeera, Hekmatyar would be offered asylum in Saudi Arabia, after which he would be allowed to return to Afghanistan with immunity from prosecution.

These are just few of the examples that show the US's double standards towards dangerous terrorist bands: whenever the terrorists are ready to work in accordance with its policies, they are regarded as friends of the US, no matter how many crimes and brutalities they have committed and continue to commit against Afghan people.

RAWA strongly believes that the withdrawal of foreign troops should be the first step, because today, with the presence of thousands of foreign troops from many countries in Afghanistan, the majority of our people are suffering from insecurity, killings, kidnapping, unemployment, rape, acid throwing on schoolgirls, hunger, lawlessness, lack of freedom of speech and many more awful disasters. Peace, security, democracy and independence can only be achieved by our own people. It is our responsibility to become united as an alternative against the occupation, to rise up, to resist and to organize our people.

Right now our people are sandwiched between three enemies. From one side we have the Taliban, from the other side are the US air strikes, and from another side are the Northern Alliance warlords in different provinces. With the troop withdrawal our people will at least get rid of one of these enemies.

The justice-loving people of the US and its democratic-minded allies should continue to pressure their government to change its fundamentalists-fostering policy and work for the disarmament of armed groups who are in the pay of the US.

We think the peace-loving people around the world should support democratic-minded individuals and forces of Afghanistan who are being suppressed and weakened by the US and its fundamentalist stooges. Only the emergence of a powerful democratic movement can lead Afghanistan towards independence and democracy.

Afghan people are deeply fed up with their current conditions and are on the verge of rising up against it. We have already seen protests and rising up of people in the face of threats and terror in a number of provinces of Afghanistan. In the future this wave will without a doubt gain momentum. With the emergence of a third front whose slogan is ""Neither Occupation Nor Taliban - Freedom and Democracy,"" Afghans will rise up to get their rights with their own power. This is a long and painful process, but the only option to lead Afghanistan toward peace and prosperity.

Non-terrorist,"Dear sisters and friends,

First of all, on behalf of Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA), I would like to thank Alliance for Education Development (AFED) and especially Tahira Abdullah, who has always been an activist and freedom-loving woman who expresses her love and solidarity with RAWA. It’s mainly because of her that I have the opportunity to participate in the conference on Girls Education.

RAWA is the oldest political/social organization of Afghan women, struggling for peace, freedom, democracy and women’s rights in fundamentalism-blighted Afghanistan since 1977. Education has been the main focus and priority issue of RAWA, and we strongly believe that only the weapon of education can empower the women of Afghanistan to gain political awareness and participate actively in struggle against fundamentalists. Because of this very fact, despite various problems and obstacles as well as insufficient resources, RAWA has taken the responsibility to administrate hundreds of literacy courses, schools and orphanages in Afghanistan and Pakistan based on its own teaching policy, promoting free-thinking and equality among all people regardless of gender, race or religion.

In countries like Afghanistan, issues such as education can not be understood without taking into account the whole political system. But no doubt, the decades of war from 1979 through the present has badly affected the education sector and deprived a generation of the opportunity to be educated. The puppet regime of Russia destroyed our educational system in the name of democracy and women’s rights, the fundamentalist Jehadis were first who not only called doors of schools “gateways to hell”, but also looted and burned books, schools and universities and kidnapped and rapped hundreds of young school girls and women. The Taliban were the most misogynist and ignorant rulers, officially banning girls from studying at schools, universities and other educational institutions, kept female teachers and doctors from their jobs and converted girls’ schools into religious madrassas.

in Afghanistan in the conference in Lahore, Feb.2, 2006.
The millions Afghan refuges in Pakistan and Iran were the most deprived victims of war and fundamentalists rule. In comparison to the 3 million refugees based in Pakistan, only a few thousand had access to education. Until recently there was no common educational policy. Fundamentalist Jehadi groups and NGOs misused funds they received for education of Afghan refugees. For instance, they would receive funds for 50,000 textbooks to be printed while they would only print 5,000 with very bad quality. More importantly, what was the mentality they were trying to build through their so-called education? Many textbooks were not of any use to the students, as books which were supposed to teach chemistry, biology, physics or Persian… were full of Hadis and Quranic verses. The methods and language used in these books showed no understanding of students, their psychology or their well-being. Imagine children in first and second grade who were learned mathematics like this:

5 guns + 5 guns = 10 guns Or, if a Muslim kills 5 infidels out of 10, how many will left alive?

And the shocking and painful fact is that from the very beginning, the US was the biggest supporter of fundamentalists in educational and cultural fields. As an example, Unocal paid $900,000 to the Center for Afghanistan Studies at the University of Omaha, Nebraska to print textbooks promoting a fundamentalist vision. Two years ago, USAID reprinted through the same university, and these textbooks were no different from those earlier written by Jehadi groups. The Washington Post in March 23, 2002 disclosed only parts of the Jihad Schoolbook Scandal.

As an outcome of this critical situation, Afghanistan has one of the world’s worst literacy rates, estimated by UNICEF at between three to four percent for females and 28 percent for males.

Since once again the fundamentalist jehadis of the “Northern Alliance,” which have long been oppressors and violators of women’s rights and education, are back in power with the support of the US and its allies, no radical change has happened in the economic, social, political and educational life of the people, particularly women. In order to deceive the outside world and make happy their masters, the Northern Alliance pays lip service to democracy and women’s education… but their mentality and treatment of women is the same. The biggest threat to Afghan girl’s education is the domination of “Northern Alliance” criminals. That is why in most provinces girls don’t feel secure, are afraid of going outside their homes and rarely have access to educational institutions near their homes.

12 years old Rahima, who was gang-raped in Takhar province on her way to school and girls like Muska who commit suicide to save their honor are clear examples of what life is like for Afghan girls under the Northern Alliance. In short, for the youth, especially school-going girls, life in Afghanistan is characterized by paralyzing physical danger. As a recently released report by Amnesty International explained, violence against females in the country is such that “Daily Afghan women are at risk of abduction and rape by armed individuals. The government is doing little to improve their condition.” Acts of violence against women are rarely investigated or punished.

Since 1987, RAWA has established a number of schools for the refugee children to impart basic knowledge and modern thoughts that the fundamentalists have denied them. Though our schools were closed due to lack of funds in 1996, we are happy to say that with donations received from supporters around the world, RAWA opened around 15 schools in Pakistan. We also have hundreds of literacy course for Afghan girls and women in almost all provinces of Afghanistan and in refugee camps in Pakistan.

During the Taliban period, RAWA, taking a great risk, managed to organize countless home-based classes throughout Afghanistan. Moreover, RAWA’s orphanages offer safety, shelter, food, clothing and a better quality of education in many cities of Afghanistan and Pakistan for hundreds of children.

With further funds, RAWA hopes to establish schools equipped with laboratories, computers, halls, libraries and other modern facilities throughout Afghanistan.

In order to provide all Afghans with good quality education, schools must remain free of cost from primary level up to university. Because of corrupt political and social system, our people are getting poorer and poorer every day. In such circumstances, talking about privatization of education or the establishment of private institutions will, at the end of the day, only fill foreigners’ packets and expand colonial culture. An American university will open in the near future where only warlord’s children can study. Similarly, because both the ministry of foreign affairs and higher education and the embassies are in the hands of the criminal “Northern Alliance”, scholarships never are given to the deserving students.

Afghanistan is still one of the poorest countries in the world. Just as its economic, cultural and social issues cannot be addressed without a radical change in the political system, its education is also a political phenomenon. By political change I mean the overthrow of the criminal warlord “Northern Alliance,” whose power is the root cause of all the miseries and sufferings of our people. Until and unless these criminals are removed from political power, one can’t hope for an essential change in education sector.

Lastly I would like to say that only those governments, organizations and individuals are true friends of Afghan people who not only don’t consider “Northern Alliance” their friends, but also strongly oppose them. We want you not to be deceived by their fashionable and stylish appearances or their speeches in the name of democracy and women’s rights. Just as our people are suffering from the economic terror, political terror and social terror of the “Northern Alliance”, to same extent are worried about education and the dark fate that is waiting for them without it. This is not only RAWA’s message, but it the voice of our people, who want the world to hear them and join hands with them in their struggle against the enemies of democracy, freedom and peace.

On behalf of RAWA, I once again thank you very much for your kind feelings, support and solidarity with the people of Afghanistan and its freedom-loving organizations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We believe in the Constitution. When we take our oath of office we actually swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United States. That’s why I do it.

There will be more than one person in the race, but we’ll get that seat back. But it is wrong to say like McBath said, that the reason she won was because of her anti-gun stance. That didn’t have anything to do with it,” Meadows said. “It had to do with being a minority female. And the Democrats really turned out, and that’s the problem we have with conservatives — we don’t turn out as well.

Non-terrorist,"These bills are a transparent attempt by gun control advocates in Congress to restrict the rights of law-abiding Americans under the guise of addressing the violent criminal culture in America.  The truth, however, is that neither of these bills will do anything to solve that problem. By giving full power to unelected government bureaucrats to indefinitely delay and prevent lawful firearm transfers, H.R. 1446 could ultimately destroy the Second Amendment rights guaranteed to every law-abiding American by turning it into a privilege enjoyed by a select few.  H.R. 8, so called “universal” background checks, cannot be enforced without a federal gun registry, will not prevent crime, and will turn otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals for simply loaning a firearm to friends or family members.​  If Congress is serious about the safety of law-abiding citizens, it should have passed concealed carry reciprocity so that Americans can safeguard themselves and their families across state lines and throughout our country during these dangerous times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Non-terrorist,"This law ensures the rights of law-abiding Arkansans are protected,” said Jason Ouimet, executive director, National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action. “Victims have little time to react when confronted with a criminal attack, they should not be required to try and run away before defending themselves. This is a common sense piece of self-defense legislation.”

Senate Bill 24 will strengthen Arkansans' fundamental right to self-defense anywhere they are legally allowed to be.  Law-abiding citizens will no longer be required by law to retreat before using force to defend themselves.  Further, victims of violent crime who respond with defensive force while protecting themselves or their loved ones should not have to face the additional threat of criminal or civil prosecution.

Thirty-four other states have passed stand your ground laws allowing their citizens to more effectively protect themselves instead of forcing unnecessary risks upon them.  

NRA would like to thank House and Senate members who supported this measure, especially bill sponsors, Rep. Aaron Pilkington, and Sen. Bob Ballinger.

""The NRA will continue standing up and stepping forward to protect and preserve our most basic, fundamental freedoms here in Montana and across the United States.""

HB 102 strengthens Montana’s self-defense laws by allowing law-abiding Montana gun owners to carry a firearm for self-defense throughout the state without a government-mandated permit. The bill also removes a number of Montana’s “gun-free zones” and ends the unnecessary disarming of Montanans as they go about their day-to-day lives. It does not change prohibited person laws, any law governing the misuse of a firearm, or when force may be used in defense of self or others.

Eighteen states – Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming – now allow law-abiding individuals to carry a concealed handgun without a government-issued permit.

Non-terrorist,"The idea for the first bus tour came about at a gurukula reunion in Los Angeles in 1993. A group of us said to ourselves, ‘What if we could organize an extended reunion that was kind of like a spiritual camping and road trip combined? We could visit Los Angeles and San Francisco Ratha-yatras on consecutive weekends, and go camping at national parks along the way.’ It sounded like a plan. With the help of a friend who owned an RV and several people bringing their cars, we went on a road trip in 1994 that turned out to be a success beyond what we had hoped for. Then we heard of this devotee who owned a bus in Denver, Kaliya Damana Prabhu, so we called him up and recruited him. In 1995 we embarked on what became the first bus tour, which we called the Youth Harinama Sankirtana Bus Tour. It included Los Angeles and San Francisco Ratha-yatras, the LA gurukula reunion, camping at national parks, hot springs, and a visit to every temple and devotee home up and down California. And, true to our name, lots of harinamas. Things kind of took off from there. I remember, in 2000, joking with our bus driver about taking the tour across North America, following the Ratha-yatra circuit. We thought it was a crazy idea, that it would take way too much driving, way too much time on the road, way too many advance preparations… The dream stuck, and with the support of Madhuha Prabhu and Festival of India, in 2001 we toured the East Cost, in 2002 the West Coast, and from 2003 on, the entire continent. The rest is, as they say, history. It’s magic. I don’t know exactly what happens, but the formula works. Take 50 devotee youth traveling on a bus tour adventure for six weeks across North America. Add lots of harinama sankirtana, Ratha-yatra festivals, and Holy Name kirtans on festival stages… reading from Krishna Book and Srila Prabhupada Lilamrita at night before we go to bed, living on a Krishna diet… I believe Lord Chaitanya works His magic on their hearts and consciousness. The devotees see how these youth are trying to help do their bit to spread Krishna consciousness far and wide, and they give their blessings, and the whole disciplic succession smiles down upon them, and all these blessings have got to amount to something. You can see the bliss in their eyes when they return from the tour, right? (It inspires me to keep on doing this.) I hope that youth come away from the tour with an experience of how fulfilling life can be when we’re serving Krishna together with love, and sharing that experience with others; that they realize Krishna consciousness is about becoming aware of a transcendent Reality that surrounds us and sustains our very being; that Krishna is supremely relevant to our lives, from the life air that we breathe, to the fire of digestion that keeps us hungry for more prasadam, to the Holy Name who manifests on our tongue and fills our hearts with joy. It’s been great to be able to serve on so many tours with my wife, Jaya Sri Radhe, and we’ve grown closer in our relationship through this service. I’ve had many faith-building experiences on the bus tours that convinced me that God exists, that serving His devotees can be blissfully exhausting at times, and that there’s nothing that gives me more satisfaction than to keep on doing this. When I get home, the first thing I do is sleep for a couple of days to recover. But after a week I’m already thinking about the next tour. The biggest challenge is re-integrating into my routine of working a day job to pay the bills, when my mind is already back on the road, planning the next Krishna conscious adventure bus tour. We held an evening festival attended by about 400 townspeople. After a particularly blissful kirtan with our youth, an elderly lady approached us on stage, accompanied by two assistants. She explained that she had been having dreams of a shaven-headed saffron-clad saintly personality with a golden complexion. She said that during our kirtan she again had a vision of Him, glowing effulgently, like molten gold, dancing in the kirtan. She wondered what the meaning of this was and if we could explain. We brought a copy of the Chaitanya Charitamrita from the bus, and began to show her paintings of Lord Chaitanya. The old lady broke out in tears and exclaimed that this was Him! This was the person she had seen dancing during the kirtan, and the person who had appeared to her in dreams since she was a little girl. She looked at the paintings as if in deep meditation for a while, then thanked us profusely, and gave us some good-luck crystals that she seemed to manifest from her hands, out of thin air. It was truly bizarre. She must have been a yogini of sorts. One of the persons who accompanied her explained that she was a clairvoyant. Moments later she disappeared in the crowds and we have never seen her since. We put the magic crystals she gave us on the bus tour altar as an offering to Sri Sri Gaura Nitai.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Non-terrorist,"The f irst time I met Srila Prabhupada was
in 1971 at the S an Francisco Rathayatra festival . I had driven
up with Karandhar to help organize the festival. And I bel ieve
that was the year that Kesava had written that wonder ful letter
to Prabhupada that Lord Jagannatha was so ill that although we ' ve
tried everything to bring Him back to health , we ' re just not pure
e nough . And so we don 't think He 's going to appear for the Rathay atra unless Your Divine Grace personal ly comes. Only by your
pure devot ion to Lord Jagannatha can the Lord become cured from
this transcendental illness. So when Prabhupada was in Europe
he got this letter and he canceled his tour. And he f lew in for
the Rathayatra . Now I ' m not sure if this ... I know this s tory took
p lace , but whether it was ' 7 1 or '73 , I ' m not sure which Rathayatra
it was . But anyway , Prabhupada was coming , it was 1971 . So K arandhar and I had gone up to the festival to organi ze it . And then
Prabhupada arrived the evening before the Rathayatra and the senior
devo tees went to the airport to p ick him up and it was tumultuous,
one of the greatest airport arrival s. I did not go myself because
I was in the k itchen cooking. But I had been to ld the de scription
of the devotees throwi ng yogurt , falling all over each other , throwi ng f lowers , j umpin� over seats , innocent passengers being pushed
aside . And it was j ust one of those tumultuous , wild airport greeti ngs; conchshells b lowing , the whole thing . So we didn 't see Prabhup ada that evening because he went to his quarters. And the next
morning , I don't k now if Prabhupada gave the morning class but I
had been dropped off at the field with a small crew of me n at around 
Srila Ramesvara , Tape I ( SR I)
dd--2
5 or 6 a . m. so I didn 't s ee Prabhupada that morning either . So I
hadn 't seen Prabhupada yet . And one by one all the members o f .
my
crew were deserting and they were racing down the whole , whatever
the name of that road is, in Golden Gate Park to get to the starti ng point of the parade to be there with Prabhupada . So by around
9 or 10 in the morning I was left all alone at the park and I was
organizing with the karmi s , the people in the park , setting up the
festival , setting up the prasadam booth and so on . And we were
working straight through the parade and then f inal ly the parade
came , the carts came , and there was this beautiful trans cendental
procession of devotees comi�g from the Subhadra chariot . The whole
park was full , completely full. There must have been between 10
and 20,000 people there in this meadow . And it was completely packed .
And right through the middle of the crowd a procession was weaving
its way like a beauti ful snake , j ust weaving its waj through the
procession. And Vi snuj ana Maharaja was there l eading the kirtan .
And right in the middle of the procession was Prabhupada . And
although this was the first time I ' d ever seen him , and although he
was not as tall as the devotees around him , he stood out so distinctly,
it was his effulgence and the transcendental atmosphere around him .
It was very distinct . And everyone could understand that the spiritual master , a great spiritual personality had arrived . So this
beauti ful proces sion wove its way all the way to the stage and then
there was an introductory kirtan on the stage . And I was still
working in the prasadam booth . I j ust looked up to see the procession and to see Prabhupada, and then I went right back to work .
And then fi nally after the introductory kirtan Prabhupada began to
speak . And j ust before he began to speak he asked to see the prasadam 
SR I
dd--3
that was being distributed. So that year the budget for prasadam
was very low . And no one had made any preparations for Prabhupada
to take prasadam at the festival. So the devotees from the stage
ran up to me because I was the only devotee in the food booth .
Everyone else was at the stage with Prabhupada . And they said ,
"" Prabhupada wants to s ample the prasadam . Make up a plate . 11 so I
made up a plate . It was a paper plate and a plastic spoon and a
plastic cup. The plastic cup had some lemonade in it and the plate
consisted of grapes and some bread , sweet bread , and a sweet . And I
think that 's al l there was . There were four preparations . There
was bread , grapes , a sweet and the lemonade . There might have been
one other preparation like .•• no , there wasn 't a popper , j ust the
bread ••• Maybe there was a mashed potato or a Gauranga potato ,
but I even doubt that . It was such a terrible feast . So I was so
disturbed to make up this plate for Prabhupada, I knew it would
be ·very di spleasing . So anyway we made up the plate for Prabhupada,
the plate was carried to him by some servant , and then gradual ly •••
I was sti ll busily working to get everything set up for serving out
the prasadam when the word came back that Prab.hupada wouldn 't • • •
he ·took one ·look at it and he wouldn 't even touch it , he wouldn 't
even taste ·any of it . He was very angry and he gave very strong
i nstructions that never again during a Rathayatra festival should
there be such skimpy prasadam. It should be so opulent with subjis
and potatoes· and all kinds of things . He was very disturbed . And
at one ·point Prabhupada wanted to dri nk some water and we didn't
have ·any water in the f ield . And we were running around . Final ly
in another park we found a hose , in another meadow , and we fi lled
one of these plastic dixie cups with the hose water and we brought 
SR I
dd--4
it to Prabhupada; So this wasn 't very together and Prabhupada was
very disturbed . So finally in the middle of his lecture the GBC
came to the food booth to i nspect it because he had been chastised .
And when he saw me there all alone he realized that I had not been
relieved yet and I hadn 't s een Prabhupada . So he rel ieved me and
I went to the stage, I worked my way. through the thick crowd and
I got right up to the front of the stage . And there 's a beauti ful
picture of Prabhupada at thi s Rathayatra festival . It was printed
on the back cover of the o ld Reservo ir of Pleasure that we used to
distribute . And Prabhupada 's face was so beautiful , so golden ,
g lowing. He h ad a red vyasas ana . And when I saw Prabhupada , I just
froze and all my feel ing of devotion was becoming mani fest . And at
o ne point Prabhupada looked at me, he saw me looking at him very
intently with whatever little devot�on I had . And when Prabhupada
looked down on me he didn 't smile, he j ust looked at me in a way
that I could understand that he was seeing that I was very devoted .
And then he went on ••• he continued speaking and I j ust burst into
tears . And that was my first actual gl impse of Sri la Prabhupada .
Then the next time I saw Prabhupada was in 1972 . At this time our
book distribution had j ust begun . The beginnings of book distribution was almost , you could say an accidental discovery . For some
time we al l knew that Prabhupada 's main work was to translate hi s
books and to have them distributed . And the conception in the
Society was that the magazines, Back to Godhead , could be di stributed
on the street sankirtana party, the Harinama party , but that books
could only be sold through book stores or to libraries or to col leges .
So the only book di stribution that was going on in those early days ,
' 6 9, ' 6 8, ' 7 0, was that type of sankirtana where one person was 
SR I
dd--5
designated in the temple to make appointments and vis it l ibrarians
and book stores . No one ever thought that you could take a book
out on the street the way-you take the Back to Godhead out . So this
was going on for a couple of years . Actually it was my service in
the first year and a half that I was in the temples , to organize
this type of book distribution . So in 197 1, a devotee in San
Francisco named Premarnava dasa and another devotee named Buddhimanta
dasa , they had the idea that they could go with the hardbound de luxe
Krsna Book volume s that had j ust been printed and di stribute them
in front of a grocery store . And the way they got this idea was
very interes ting . One day they were coming home from some Harinama
party and they had a few hardbound Krsna Books in the vehicle and
they stopped at a gas station . And when it came time to pay for
the gas , one of them j ust had the idea to bring out the Krsna Book
and show it to the person . And as they began preaching and they
saw that the gas station attendant was very interested in the book ,
they suggested that i nstead of paying him for the gas he take the
book . And he agreed ! So that was astonishing . And from that incident they got the idea to try taking the Krsna Books to the grocery
store or the supermarket which was across the street from the San
Francisco temple . Now this isn 't the first time Krsna Books were
di stributed . The first time Krsna Books were distributed was the
day they a rrived , which was I think the 19 70 Rathayatra . And all
the advance copies during that festival were sold , including Prabhupada ' s personal copies. But since that time nobody had done anything
with Krsna Books other than the s tores and the libraries .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-terrorist,"The Camp for Climate Action spearheads a radical movement against the “causes of climate change”. What are those causes?

I’m no expert but the key cause of climate change is the release of carbon out of the earth back up into the atmosphere as CO2. All the carbon from the trees and plants that have been slowly getting squashed to make coal, oil and gas over millions of years is now being released very quickly into the atmosphere. This quick release started at the Industrial Revolution and has been speeding up ever since. So the main cause is the burning of these fossil fuels for transport (e.g. cars and planes), making electricity (e.g. coal and gas fired power stations) and the manufacture of just about everything we use in the modern world (e.g. fertiliser for food from oil, electricity for factories and homes). There is also methane, emitted by the huge amount of cows we now have on earth, landfill (where household waste is buried underground) and other places such as the permafrost, which is now starting to melt and release huge amounts of methane.

You can therefore say that behind this, a key cause is modern life – capitalism and consumerism which focus only on profit. Also the individualistic nature of these, where other people and our impacts on them (whether in producing trainers or losing agricultural land through climate change) are ignored. This is completely unsustainable in every sense of the word – we depend on the earth for our survival (air, water, food) so destroying it is not an option if we are to survive. But the way we live, or at least those of us that do the mass consuming and live in capitalist systems, is doing just that.

The Camps were no spontaneous gatherings but were meticulously organised. How many people were involved with the planning process?

I’d say around 150. Some of these were working on camp stuff for an hour a week or less, others were doing it more like a part time job for several months. Some worked on the camp over 8 months, others did their bit nearer the start or end of the process. At each monthly weekend-long gathering (where key decisions were made) there were 50-80 people. Some people came to every gathering, some to most and some just to one. So there was a core of the same people (maybe 30) every time but also the group was different every time.

Working groups also met at these gatherings. These were smaller groups with a specific focus e.g. Networking (website, media and publicising the camp) and Site Practicalities (infrastructure and transport). They had autonomy to work on their particular areas but any big decisions, which affected the whole process or camp, were taken to the full gathering and decided by everyone. There were also smaller working groups (e.g. entertainments, kids) who mainly met at other times or worked together through phone calls and e-mail. All members of working groups did lots of work outside of gatherings and many met between as well as at them.

In gatherings and working group meetings consensus decision-making was used – allowing all voices to be heard and everyone’s say to be equal and drawing together the best of everyone’s ideas to reach a decision that everyone was happy with. This was tricky at times but meant that all decisions were collectively reached.

Also local groups (e.g. Yorkshire, West Midlands) got together to organise neighbourhoods. Before the 2006 camp these were mainly just organising to get a kitchen, shelter and people to the camp. After the camp some of them became local action groups, taking action against the causes of climate change locally as well as organising a neighbourhood for the 2007 camp.

The land on which both Camps were held was squatted. How was it occupied?

I wasn’t actually involved in this but in 2006 small groups of people (about 80 people in total) were transported to near the site and dropped off at different places. This was in the middle of the night. They then walked onto the site. A fence was erected and legal notices put up. A complex scaffold tripod was erected and some attached themselves to it so that eviction would be harder. A few marquees were erected. This was all done before about 6am. That all sounds quite simple but it took an awful lot of planning and organising, which had to be done in secret.

In 2007 a similar method was used. Small groups of people from different parts of the country got themselves to places near the site – transport was less of a problem in an urban location – then when the coast was clear walked onto the site and carried on as last year but with a simpler and quicker to set up fence and a spectacular double tripod which it seems was erected in seconds, well minutes. Both times it took the police a few hours to find the site, by which time infrastructure was well under way.

The focal points of the Camps were the “days of mass action”. What did these actions aim to achieve?

There were several aims in 2006. The first was to shut down one of the root causes of climate change: Drax coal fired power station. It seems crazy to try to shut down a power station but it’s much crazier to still be burning coal in such huge quantities so it’s a proportionate response. Secondly we wanted to get media attention to let people know just how crazy it is to be burning fossil fuels and that people are willing to take direct action to stop it. Thirdly the aim was to inspire people – who were on the action, at the camp or heard about it – to take direct action against the root causes of climate change. As well as being inspired people could also attend training and workshops and talk to each other so that they had more idea of how to take action. The aim was to build the growing network of climate change activists, and that people joining this network would come from lots of different backgrounds not just the ‘usual suspects’. This last aim seems the least tangible but you should never underestimate the potential of physically getting lots of people together in one place who share a common purpose, and then telling loads more people about it.

In 2007 the second and third aims were the same and were definitely expanded on – we got huge media attention and a lot more people got themselves clued up and joined the action. Also a dozen smaller actions took place around the same time as the mass action – BP, carbon offset companies, a nuclear power station and an airport owner were targeted by small affinity groups. The first aim was to disrupt Heathrow airport but by targeting the corporations – BA and BAA – not passengers. These corporations are pushing for airport expansion and a third runway in the full knowledge that this gives the UK zero chance of meeting even its 60% CO2 reduction targets., Basically they want to commit us to runaway climate change. So this year we wanted to tell BA and BAA exactly how appalling their actions are and support the ongoing local campaigns against airport noise, pollution and expansion by telling the whole world about the proposed third runway and the wider impact on climate change and all our lives.

Why and how was the decision made to target Heathrow airport in the first place?

The decision was made by a process of consensus decision-making at a gathering of about 100 people, one of the open public monthly meetings. Detailed information on six different locations was provided by the Land group who had spent months researching different potential sites.

How do you measure success or failure?

I don’t think you can. The camp was definitely a huge success both years in that we achieved our aims, but it’s so much more than that. For me there are many successes, small and large but all important. Just mobilising enough people to organise the camp was a huge success, as was each bit of positive media coverage we received or each person inspired.

I don’t think you can say that something as complex as Climate Camp was simply a success or a failure, and to do so is to completely detract from our whole ethos which is that there is no one solution to climate change, that people need to find new and various ways of working together, that we are trying out new ways of living, being, thinking and organising here. This is all about a complex, diverse, ever-changing way of behaving not about simple black and white choices between A or B. So there were multiple successes and lots of failures too, but I’d see these more as part of our learning and our experiment. Like some of the meetings at the camp were very difficult, people didn’t participate in a fair way and bad decisions were made. However, that is both a failure and a success if in the process lots of people learnt better how to conduct themselves in meetings to make them work well. You can only succeed or fail if you have set, concrete and immovable aims. Thankfully Climate Camp isn’t like that – if it was then it would be just another political party or ideology-based group.

This isn’t to say that we shouldn’t think about success or failure, of course we should, but that it would be dangerous and counterproductive to measure it in the terms it is usually measured in, say in the contexts of business or elections. It may make us sound like we’re fobbing off the person asking whether we succeeded or failed, but people need to start thinking in different ways if we are to change the world enough to escape the most devastating effects of climate change. It is up to us to demonstrate and live these different ways, and to inspire others to do the same by the way we act and what we say. For me the camp was a huge and ever-changing experiment in collective living which was incredibly exciting. We started off at this year’s set-up with maybe 150 people who were already used to DIY culture and working collectively, then every day more and more people arrived who weren’t used to that but started to learn about it, be inspired by it and consider how they could take it back into their homes, communities, workplaces and anywhere else they found themselves. This was incredible to be part of. Every day in the Welcome tent I met dozens of people for whom this was all completely new, and every day I saw someone who I’d welcomed yesterday taking part in consensus decision making, being a legal observer, cooking with others to feed 200…now that’s what I call a success!

The only thing I would be tempted to call a failure would be if the taking of the land hadn’t worked or we’d been evicted straight away, but even that wouldn’t have been a complete failure. It would be a failure in that the aim of taking a site wasn’t achieved, but so many of our other aims would have been achieved because a huge amount of people would already have been inspired and mobilised and we’d have run at least the workshops somewhere else. It was portrayed that not shutting down Drax was a failure, but again that’s only if you take a narrow view of what success and failure are. It wasn’t a failure to me – it would have been great if we had shut it down but the real impact and therefore success was still there in the money it cost them for security, the huge amount of adverse publicity and the fact that lots and lots of people really started to think about coal and why we really have to stop burning it.

Also, for me personally and for many others, we understood what direct action is all about and were inspired to support or carry it out ourselves. For me one of the biggest successes you can have when campaigning on any issue is to educate people – be it information, ideas, attitudes or behaviour. Every single person that has ever campaigned, protested, taken action or stood up to be counted was inspired and educated at some point which set them off on that path; whether through reading something, seeing something, hearing something or talking to someone. So, just getting our message and our ways of living, working and being out there was, to me, actually our biggest success.

Will there be a third Camp for Climate Action?

Who knows! There are regional meetings taking place through September for local groups and neighbourhoods to get back together and decide what they can do next. Then there will be a national gathering in October where everyone will decide what next. Anyone who comes can input into this. Lots of people assume there will be a third camp but there are lots of other ideas to consider too. Whatever happens though, this ever-growing movement for action on climate change is not going away. I can’t wait to be a part of what happens next…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Non-terrorist,"Over the last few days, a small gang of anarchists and social ecologists have been smearing Deep Green Resistance with accusations of “eco-fascism.” Normally, we like to ignore these ridiculous lies and the toxic people who make them. But for the sake of clarity, and because the issue of eco-fascism is an important one that we don't often touch on, please know:
Deep Green Resistance is 100% an anti-fascist organization. All forms of fascism, “ecological” or otherwise, rest on a foundation of white supremacy, patriarchy, and industrialism – three atrocities that DGR categorically rejects. It is an inherently hateful, destructive ideology that has no place in the environmentalist movement or anywhere else. As part of our dedication to resisting all forms of oppression, many of our members have put their lives on the line organizing against white nationalists, Nazis, and other reactionary scumbags. Be assured that any endorsement of fascism is and always will be grounds for dismissal from Deep Green Resistance, and that we consider the entire notion to be morally depraved and philosophically bankrupt.
These most recent accusations are dishonestly capitalizing on an interview one of our leaders, Derrick Jensen, did with Hubert Collins. Collins reached out to Derrick and asked for an interview, which Derrick gave. Unfortunately, Collins posted the interview on Counter Currents, a right-wing news website that hosts anti-feminist, conservative, and white nationalist content. Derrick was unaware of Collins’ views and disavowed him completely upon finding out. Nothing in the interview itself even hints at any fascist views or duplicitous motives. And if you don’t trust us, trust them – Collins himself prefaces the interview by saying that Derrick is an opponent of white supremacy and “surely hates everything about Counter Currents.” 
This is actually a fairly common problem with prominent leftist voices – Noam Chomsky, for example, once gave an interview to Hustler magazine without realizing it would be sandwiched in between vile pornography. Of course, the armchair activists attacking us are not receiving interview requests from anyone, so it stands to reason that they wouldn’t understand how things like this can happen. But happen they do, and only the most disingenuous and opportunistic trolls would see them as evidence of secret fascist sympathies. 
There is nothing new to these accusations, of course. We in Deep Green Resistance have been routinely smeared as fascists for years now. The reason why is simple: Because DGR proudly rejects the white-chauvinist, Eurocentric settler mindset of the modern American left. Most fundamentally, we are not a human supremacist organization. We believe that environmentalism exists to defend the health and freedom of the whole living world, of which human beings are merely a small (but precious!) part. Further, we believe that, when our way of living comes into conflict with the health of the land and the non-humans with which we share it, our way of living is what must go. 
For many people, these are upsetting statements; for those activists whose idea of liberation is tied up with air-conditioned subway cars and automated luxury goods, they can be downright terrifying! It’s no wonder, then, that so many techno-utopians are quick to assume that we support sterilization, eugenics, “population control,” or even mass killings or genocide. Nothing could be further from the truth, of course. All those things are both morally unacceptable and practically foolish. DGR advocates for the targeted abolition of industrial civilization, not indiscriminate destruction or mass extinction. To be honest, we find it particularly sad that so many “environmentalists” simply cannot imagine a biocentric worldview apart from these atrocities – but their lack of imagination is not our fault, and we’d appreciate it if they stopped making up nonsense.
Deep Green Resistance has also been accused of supporting nationalism, Trumpian border walls, and even white separatism. These are more ridiculous lies. No one in DGR approves of the Trump administration’s policies towards migrants, or those of any imperial politician. However, unlike many other American leftists, our hatred of colonial borders comes from the colonial part, as opposed to the blanket rejection of any and all restrictions on movement. We believe that the land belongs to its indigenous keepers, and that their historical and cultural ties to that land are to be celebrated, revered, and protected. We don’t believe that “the Earth belongs to everyone,” or that a perfect world would be one in which the children of colonizers are allowed “free movement” over the lands of the colonized. In our perfect world, settler-colonialism is abolished and what belongs to the indigenous is returned to the indigenous – not redistributed to the settler nation. 
Unfortunately, this is enough to have many anarchists and social ecologists – steeped as they are in the Manifest Destiny ideology and its pathological hatred of boundaries – to accuse us of closet fascism. Some have gone so far as to compare our defense of indigenous land ownership to the “Blood and Soil” politics of the National Socialists in Germany! The Eurocentric chauvinism required to conflate every possible form of national identity with the specific depravity of white supremacy is as dumbfounding as it is disgusting. We can only encourage these folks to look beyond 20th century European history for a change, as uncomfortable as that might make them. Hopefully, they would come to learn from indigenous notions of tribal, national, and ethnic identity that are distinct from Europe’s pathetic and vicious fixation on the colonial fantasy of race.
You may have heard the expression, “When you’re used to privilege, equality can feel like oppression.” Well, the settler-colonial left needs to learn that when you’re used to complete and total freedom, any boundary can feel like fascism. After all, prominent leftist heroes like Jean-Paul Sartre and Michel Foucault condemned the “police state” for preventing men from raping children. Other leftist figures in the United States denounced the Black Panthers and the American Indian movement as “bourgeois nationalists” for excluding whites. We in Deep Green Resistance are tired of this Eurocentric, patriarchal chauvinism, never moreso than when it is passed off as some sort of radical devotion to social justice. We will continue to organize as a radically anti-colonial, radically anti-patriarchal, radically anti-industrial – and yes, radically anti-fascist – movement. We encourage those who make a name for themselves smearing us to get off Facebook and Twitter for a moment and try to do the same.

Our story.

Extinction Rebellion is a global movement that uses non-violent civil disobedience in an attempt to halt mass extinction and minimise the risk of social collapse.

On 31st October 2018, British activists assembled on Parliament Square in London to announce a Declaration of Rebellion against the UK Government. The next few weeks were a whirlwind. Six thousand rebels converged on London to peacefully block five major bridges across the Thames. Trees were planted in the middle of Parliament Square, and hole was dug there to bury a coffin representing our future. Rebels super-glued themselves to the gates of Buckingham Palace as they read a letter to the Queen.

Extinction Rebellion was born.

The call to rebel swiftly became global, with groups popping up the following week in Europe, the US, and soon after the world over. Leaderless and truly global, each new group makes the movement stronger, bringing in new perspectives, wisdom, expertise, energy and inspiration.

Why rebel?

What you can do.
The time to act is now.

Traditional strategies like petitioning, lobbying, voting and protest have not worked due to the rooted interests of political and economic forces. Our approach is therefore one of non-violent, disruptive civil disobedience – a rebellion to bring about change, since all other means have failed.

Non-terrorist,"Why rebel?
We are in the midst of a climate and ecological breakdown. We are facing an uncertain future - our world is in crisis and life itself is under threat. Now is not the time to ignore the issues; now is the time to act as if the truth is real. The science is clear. We are in the midst of a mass extinction of our own making and our governments are not doing enough to protect their citizens, our resources, our biodiversity, our planet, and our future.

This crisis knows no borders, race or ethnicity, and while wealth may offer some protection, it is all but temporary. The clock is ticking, and if we don’t succeed in uniting to protect our planet, everyone will be impacted - you, your family, everyone and everything you hold dear…

…and yet every crisis contains the possibility of transformation.

Here’s The Problem:
We’ve all heard it before - the Earth is getting hotter, CO2 levels are rising, and we are in the midst of the Sixth Mass Extinction (The Anthropocene Extinction). We are facing two equally critical issues - biodiversity loss and climate change. Both are having unprecedented dire consequences not only on us as humans, but on every living being and ecosystem on the planet. It is beyond a doubt that human activities are triggering these changes.













The Possibility of Transformation
We are standing on a precipice. We can acknowledge the truth of what we are facing, or we can continue to kick the can down the road and allow the effects of a heating planet to have even more detrimental outcomes on all living beings. We are already locked in to a certain amount of warming and biodiversity loss, but there is still time to change this story.




What Makes XR Different?
We are paving a different path. The world we want to live in requires a culture that is healthy, creative, resilient and adaptable. We are facing tough choices and so far, these catastrophes have been met with little effort from governments and institutions to change the trajectory we are on.










You are XR
Extinction Rebellion is made up of people from all walks of life, different backgrounds, cultures, and political affiliations - people like you, coming together to create a different story. We know the crisis we are facing, and we want to change the future. This fight is all of ours, and we all need to be willing to stand up for the truth and face it together.






Non-violent Civil Disobedience
With over 1169 groups in 76 countries, we are already making a difference. XR has been credited for compelling legislation, pushing governments to take action, and shifting the public discourse on the climate and ecological crisis through our creative, artful, sustained, non-violent protests all over the world.We follow in the footsteps of many who have come before us. From India’s Independence Movement to Women’s Suffrage, the Civil Rights Movement to the Arab Spring, history has shown us time and time again that nonviolent protest does work as a powerful means to bring about change.And yet, there are no guarantees. As rebels, we know that tomorrow’s reality is today’s concern. A world ravaged by climate change and biodiversity loss is one that will gravely affect us all.

Why Rebel
We have no other choice. We rebel against the systems that got us here. We rebel for the future we want. We rebel because it is our responsibility to act. We have no more time to waste. Nothing is impossible - we can still write the story we want and we will. We as individuals can make a difference, collectively. We will do this together - transform the world, create lasting change and build a better future for all.
