# GloVe in R using Quanteda package 
Comparing word embeddings of terrorism text documents and non-terrorism text documents

# The data:
- Terrorism text document data = "only_tertext_data.csv"
- Non-terrorism text document data = "only_nontertext_data.csv"

Data was collected from a myriad of online sources, and the text documents obtained include online interviews, prison interviews, magazine articles, Tweets, and other samples of text (written and spoken) both from members of terrorist organizations and from members of non-terrorist organizations. 

Here, terrorist organizations refer to groups that (a) seek political, religious, economic, or other societal change and (b) use violence in pursuit of their goals. Non-terrorist organizations refer to groups that seek political, religious, economic, or other societal change but donâ€™t use violence in pursuit of their goals.

Terrorists in the current sample include individuals affiliated with ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Al Shabaab, the Animal Liberation Front, the Ku Klux Klan, Skinheads, the Irish Republican Army (IRA), and the Deep Green Resistance. Non-terrorists in the current sample include individuals affiliated with the Society of the Muslim Brothers in Egypt, the Dalit Buddhist Movement, the Church of Scientology, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, the National Rifle Association (NRA), the Camp for Climate Action, and the Extinction Rebellion. 

The current sample of data includes 151 text documents.
