Terrorist,"I was born in the Arabian Peninsula. I was also a student in the United Kingdom for some time. I decided to write this short message before I do a martyrdom operation. To our brothers in Islām who are in the kufār countries (America, France, United Kingdom … etc.): You defnitely know what is happening to the Islāmic ummah and Muslims all over the world. The kufār are killing our brothers and raping our sisters while we stand by and do nothing to prevent it, the exact opposite of what Islām teaches us. The frst thing I say to Muslims in America and the European countries is that you are in the heart of nations of the kufār. You are in a place that too many Mujahedeen wish they were in, so that they can beat the kufār in their own countries, destroy their peace as they destroy ours; force them to stop the war against Muslims. And force them to leave the Arabian Peninsula as well as all other Muslim countries, move the war from our lands to theirs and keep fighting them until we let Islām rule the whole planet. Being in the heart of the nations of kufār is a chance Allāh has given you to punish the kufār in their own territory. So do not do like I did and leave without doing anything. The second thing is that when you make a small operation in America or European countries you gain more results than a huge operation outside their home. ... And remember that Jihād is not dependent on a specific person and you are not being asked about what others have done to defend Muslims from the brutish attack on Islām. ... Allāh will ask you alone about what you did for Islām. So do not hesitate or even think twice, all you need is just to follow the steps that the Mujahedeen give you in 'Inspire Magazine' and ask Allāh to make it easy for you. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terrorist,"""All praise is due to Allāh, the Lord of the Worlds. Jihād is an obligation from Allāhجل جلاله . Young Muslims are brought up into it since the day the Messenger of Allāh صلى الله عليه وسلم carried the sword until the last of this nation will fight against the False Messiah. Jihād will continue throughout the generations of Muslims.The organization of al-Qā`idah is among these generations of Muslims who are carrying the responsibility of calling to Islām and defending the holy sites, the religion, honor and land since its foundation before three decades. Since 1990 when the Americans occupied the land of revelation, the youth of the Peninsula of Islām are defending their religion, their holy places and their land which their Messenger, peace be upon him, ordered to expel from it the disbelievers. They have executed a few operations against the Americans in and out of the Arabian Peninsula. The most famous are the Ulaya, al-Khobar, East Riyadh, USS Cole, Limburg, and the assassination of US soldiers in the island of Faylakah in Kuwait. The leaders of al-Qā`idah such as Shaykh al-Battār Yūsuf al- `Uyaīrī, `Abdul `Azīz al-Miqrin, and Shaykh Abū `Alī al-Ĥārithī and others led this war against the Americans in and outside of the Arabian Peninsula. We are proud with this legacy not only as Muslims but as freemen too. The organization of AQAP, as our beloved leader Shaykh Usāmah said: “With America entering into con$ict with the sons of the land of the two holy places, it will forget the terrors of Vietnam. And, by the will of Allāh, the upcoming victory in the land of Ĥijāz and Najd will make America forget the horrors of Vietnam and Beirut, by the permission of Allāh, Glorified and Exalted be He.” Our objectives are driving out the occupiers from the Arabian Peninsula and purifying its land from them, establishing the law of sharī`ah, the establishment of khilāfah, spreading the call to the oneness of Allāh جل جلاله ,defending against the transgressors and helping the weak. All praise is due to Allāh, the Lord of the Worlds, Allāh جل جلاله has blessed us with e""""ective operations against the transgressing Americans and we ask Allāh to grant us more. The interest that is shown towards AQAP is because of the strategic importance of the Arabian Peninsula. This is the place of the revelation, the birthplace of Islām, the land of the two holy Mosques and the blood of the saĥāba runs through the veins of its sons. Because of the greed of the Americans, they have vital interests in the Arabian Peninsula. The passageways of commerce pass through its waters and oil is stolen from it. So this place is a vein of life for the Americans. Thus they are focused on it and they do not want any con$icts in this area or any group that would protect the wealth of the Muslims and their religion. They fear that their plots would be foiled and their dreams brought to an end. To answer your question on how serious the danger of AQAP is, I say that wherever there are mujāhidīn, there is danger awaiting the disbelievers. The mujāhidīn are one body and if one of them is somewhere you would find fear and terror spreading in that place. All of the branches of al-Qā`idah have succeeded in powerful operations against the Americans and the latest is the car bomb in New York. The di""""erent branches have good competition in fighting the Americans and their allies. All of them want to win the race of destroying the idol (i.e. , America) and to have the greatest share in that effort. All praise is due to Allāh, the targeting of Muĥammad bin Nayif was part of our e""""ort to purify the Arabian Peninsula from the traitors. He and his ilk are the ones who allowed the Americans to set base in the Peninsula of Islām, playing the role of Abū Ruqāl in its worst forms. He is an American in the clothes of an Arab. If it wasn’t for these traitors, the American airplanes wouldn’t have bombed Iraq and Afghanistan from the airports of Kharj and Riyadh and others, and if wasn’t for them, the Jews wouldn’t have remained in Palestine for more than sixty years. So this evil deformed person who is leading the war against the mujāhidīn, who is plotting against them day and night, and is implementing the American agenda, has led us to target him because of his actions. Some of the results of this blessed operation are that it turned the attention of the mujāhidīn to target the leaders of disbelief and the plotters of evil and that reaching them is not di&cult by the will of Allāh. This operation broke the legend of the infallibility of their security measures and made it clear that the heroic mujāhid - by properly concealing his device, not having any metal parts in it and putting his trust in Allāh جل جلاله - can reach to his target without being exposed. All praise is due to Allāh, the operation of `Umar al-Fārūq – may Allāh hasten his release – is a strong blow to the con of the Because of the greed of the Americans, they have vital interests in the Arabian Peninsula. The passageways of commerce pass through its waters and oil is stolen from it. So this place is a vein of life for the Americans. American economy and is a slap in the face of the American security apparatus. He reached his destination and was able to break through all of the strict security barriers after passing through a few airports and was searched in them. But through the blessing of Allāh جل جلاله ,all security equipment failed to display his explosive device. The message we intended on sending to the Americans is: “America will never enjoy security until we live it in Palestine and it is not fair for you to enjoy life while our brothers in Gaza are going through a difficult life.” The fruits of the operation are many. Some of which: t Great loss to the US economy which reached $41 billion and all of their security measures have gone with the wind. The fear which has spread throughout airports and security institutions has revealed to the American people that its security institutions are not to be counted upon. Delivering fear to the American people and creating a balance in fear and that security is not something that the government of Obama can control. Opening the door for many Muslim youth in the West who want to seek revenge from the Crusader states that are fighting Islām. What we want from the West is one thing: To stop aggression and oppression against the Muslim Nation and to withdraw out of its land. This solution was given by all of our leaders and in more than one occasion. The truce was offered by the one who has real authority to take such a decision on behalf of the Muslims, Shaykh Usāmah bin Lādin, may Allāh preserve him. His o""""er was refused. Whenever we o""""er a sound plan, they escalate in their stubbornness so we are left with no option but to defend ourselves and fight the transgressors. If the West refrains from attacking us and oppressing our Nation, we will refrain from them. Otherwise we will have them drink from the same cup that they have the innocent from our Nation drink from. The American culture is that of killing other people. How many have the Americans killed from the Vietnamese, the Japanese, the Iraqi people, the Afghani people, and the Somali people, and how many have the Zionist allies killed from the sons of Palestine with the support of these bloodthirsty beasts? And finally they have killed tens from the tribe of Bākāzim, Arĥab and al-`Awāliq. They have killed women and children and lied by saying that these were preemptive strikes against al-Qā`idah in order to justify to their people that they have killed the leaders of al-Qā`idah. The Yemeni government jumped not to defend its sovereignty and its innocent people but to condemn the oppressed and justify for the Americans their crimes. They marketed the American bombing as a bombing performed by their air force against al-Qā`idah when they knew that the casualties were Bedouins. But it seems as if the Yemeni government has settled some previous scores while the women and children pay the price at the hand of the Americans. And what are these accurate operations that have killed tens of children and women? If the pilot was ignorant of military matters he would still be able to tell the di""""erence between tents of bedouins and military sites, but it is American hate and lust for killing others. These bombings will not deliver anything to the Americans and will not weaken the organization by the blessings of Allāh. Instead they will only advance us further and push the Muslim people to stand with us. These reckless acts of the Americans will only reveal to the Muslim people the reality of the democracy of murder and destruction. The president of Yemen is a professional liar, especially when it comes to lying in order to extort money. Such lies bring in dollars from the Americans. They are gullible and he is creating for them fake victories. As the caller to Islām, Shaykh Anwar al-`Awlakī, may Allāh preserve him, said: “The distinctive mark of the Yemeni government is lying. They are lying to their people. They are lying to the outside world. They are lying to everyone.” They have been lying for thirty years. They lie against their people in an exposed fashion and this proves to us their inability to defend themselves let alone others and that the matter is out of their hands now. Thus, they have nothing else to do but lie and claim that we have killed so-and-so and imprisoned so-and-so. This is all in order that foreign assistance keeps flowing in. All praise is due to Allāh. America is the one forcing us to target it. These heinous crimes which the human soul rejects such as the cartoons of the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and holding celebrations and awarding those who curse the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم require us to target the Americans. In fact they require us to wipe them out of the map completely. America is a cancer that needs to be removed along with the West that is supporting this criminal behavior and are banning the niqāb of the chaste and pure Muslim women. Thus, we insist on fighting against this oppression and aggression. The issue now is not fighting for peoples’ lives, land or wealth as the obligation has become greater than that. The issue now is the defense of the Prophets and supporting them against these obscene people. For them there is no way out from the punishment of Allāh because Allāh جل جلاله will protect His Messengers. Allāh جل جلاله protects the believers so wouldn’t he protect His Prophets who are the most beloved to Him and are the chosen ones of His creation? Allāh جل جلاله will give us victory against them and what America awaits in the coming days is greater and worse than what has passed by the will of Allāh: Allāh جل جلاله says: (Say: “Do you await for us except one of the two best things [i.e., martyrdom or victory] while we await for you that Allāh will a(ict you with punishment from Himself or at our hands? So wait; indeed we, along with you, are waiting). My advice to my Muslim brothers in the West is to acquire weapons and learn methods of war. They are living in a place where they can cause great harm to the enemy and where they can support the Messenger of Allāh صلى الله عليه وسلم There is no meaning in life if the Messenger of Allāh صلى الله عليه وسلم is cursed while they listen to and see such crimes being committed in front of their eyes. It is not enough to defend him, may my father and mother be sacrificed for him, to participate in demonstrations and protests because these methods would not stop the West which is already used to them. The successful means are through explosive devices and sacrificing souls. That is a more pronounced and successful way of defending him and this is a practice started by the Ţālibān of Pakistan, Niđāl Ĥassan, and `Umar al-Fārūq, may Allāh release them and on this path are men who are coming to you by the will of Allāh. O Muslims rise up in defense of your Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم :a man with his knife, a man with his gun, a man with his rifle, a man with his bomb, by learning how to design explosive devices, by burning down forests and buildings, or by running over them with your cars and trucks. The means of harming them are many so seek assistance from Allāh جل جلاله and do not be weak and you will find a way. The rights of the Messenger of Allāh صلى الله عليه وسلم upon us are great and it is nothing for all of us to die for his sake; may our mothers be bereaved of us if we do not defend him صلى الله عليه وسلم. O Muslims you have no excuse in front of Allāh except if you fight in defense of his Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم .If you cannot fight, then you should emigrate from the land where he is being cursed because such a land is awaiting the wrath of Allāh. Especially that the Messenger of Allāh صلى الله عليه وسلم discouraged living amongst the disbelievers so how about living at ease amongst them when the Messenger of Allāh صلى الله عليه وسلم is being attacked and you do nothing to defend him or leave the land where he is being cursed? What will you answer your Lord on the Day of Judgment? If you fail to emigrate, then at least boycott the disbelievers and proclaim the oneness of Allāh جل جلاله ,Walā’ and Barā’ and pray to Allāh جل جلاله to make a way out for you. May Allāh جل جلاله grant us success in giving victory to His religion and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم. And all praises and thanks belong to Allāh, the Lord of the Worlds.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terrorist,"The call to wage war against America was made because America has spearheaded the crusade against the Islamic nation, sending tens of thousands of its troops to the land of the two Holy Mosques over and above its meddling in its affairs and its politics, and its support of the oppressive, corrupt and tyrannical regime that is in control. These are the reasons behind the singling out of America as a target. And not exempt of responsibility are those Western regimes whose presence in the region offers support to the American troops there. We know at least one reason behind the symbolic participation of the Western forces and that is to support the Jewish and Zionist plans for expansion of what is called the Great Israel. Surely, their presence is not out of concern over their interests in the region. ... Their presence has no meaning save one and that is to offer support to the Jews in Palestine who are in need of their Christian brothers to achieve full control over the Arab Peninsula which they intend to make an important part of the so called Greater Israel. There is an Arabic proverb that says ""she accused me of having her malady, then snuck away."" Besides, terrorism can be commendable and it can be reprehensible. Terrifying an innocent person and terrorizing him is objectionable and unjust, also unjustly terrorizing people is not right. Whereas, terrorizing oppressors and criminals and thieves and robbers is necessary for the safety of people and for the protection of their property. There is no doubt in this. Every state and every civilization and culture has to resort to terrorism under certain circumstances for the purpose of abolishing tyranny and corruption. Every country in the world has its own security system and its own security forces, its own police and its own army. They are all designed to terrorize whoever even contemplates to attack that country or its citizens. The terrorism we practice is of the commendable kind for it is directed at the tyrants and the aggressors and the enemies of Allah, the tyrants, the traitors who commit acts of treason against their own countries and their own faith and their own prophet and their own nation. Terrorizing those and punishing them are necessary measures to straighten things and to make them right. Tyrants and oppressors who subject the Arab nation to aggression ought to be punished. The wrongs and the crimes committed against the Muslim nation are far greater than can be covered by this interview. America heads the list of aggressors against Muslims. The recurrence of aggression against Muslims everywhere is proof enough. For over half a century, Muslims in Palestine have been slaughtered and assaulted and robbed of their honor and of their property. Their houses have been blasted, their crops destroyed. And the strange thing is that any act on their part to avenge themselves or to lift the injustice befalling them causes great agitation in the United Nations which hastens to call for an emergency meeting only to convict the victim and to censure the wronged and the tyrannized whose children have been killed and whose crops have been destroyed and whose farms have been pulverized. ...
In today's wars, there are no morals, and it is clear that mankind has descended to the lowest degrees of decadence and oppression. They rip us of our wealth and of our resources and of our oil. Our religion is under attack. They kill and murder our brothers. They compromise our honor and our dignity and dare we utter a single word of protest against the injustice, we are called terrorists. This is compounded injustice. And the United Nations insistence to convict the victims and support the aggressors constitutes a serious precedence which shows the extent of injustice that has been allowed to take root in this land. ...
Cooperation for the sake of truth and righteousness is demanded from Muslims. A Muslim should do his utmost to cooperate with his fellow Muslims. But Allah says of cooperation that it is not absolute for there is cooperation to do good, and there is cooperation to commit aggression and act unjustly. A Muslim is supposed to give his fellow Muslim guidance and support. He (Allah) said ""Stand by your brother be he oppressor or oppressed."" When asked how were they to stand by him if he were the oppressor, He answered them, saying ""by giving him guidance and counsel."" It all goes to say that Muslims should cooperate with one another and should be supportive of one another, and they should promote righteousness and mercy. They should all unite in the fight against polytheism and they should pool all their resources and their energy to fight the Americans and the Zionists and those with them. They should, however, avoid side fronts and rise over the small problems for these are less detrimental. Their fight should be directed against unbelief and unbelievers. ...As we have already said, our call is the call of Islam that was revealed to Mohammed. It is a call to all mankind. We have been entrusted with good cause to follow in the footsteps of the Messenger and to communicate his message to all nations. It is an invitation that we extend to all the nations to embrace Islam, the religion that calls for justice, mercy and fraternity among all nations, not differentiating between black and white or between red and yellow except with respect to their devotedness. All people who worship Allah, not each other, are equal before Him. We are entrusted to spread this message and to extend that call to all the people. We, nonetheless, fight against their governments and all those who approve of the injustice they practice against us. We fight the governments that are bent on attacking our religion and on stealing our wealth and on hurting our feelings. And as I have mentioned before, we fight them, and those who are part of their rule are judged in the same manner. ..Praise be Allah and prayers and peace upon Mohammed. With respect to the Western governments that participated in the attack on the land of the two Holy Mosques regarding it as ownerless, and in the siege against the Muslim people of Iraq, we have nothing new to add to the previous message. What prompted us to address the American government in particular is the fact that it is on the head of the Western and the crusading forces in their fight against Islam and against Muslims. The two explosions that took place in Riyadh and in Khobar recently were but a clear and powerful signal to the governments of the countries which willingly participated in the aggression against our countries and our lives and our sacrosanct symbols. It might be beneficial to mention that some of those countries have begun to move towards independence from the American government with respect to the enmity that it continues to show towards the Muslim people. We only hope that they will continue to move in that direction, away from the oppressive forces that are fighting against our countries. We however, differentiate between the western government and the people of the West. If the people have elected those governments in the latest elections, it is because they have fallen prey to the Western media which portray things contrary to what they really are. And while the slogans raised by those regimes call for humanity, justice, and peace, the behavior of their governments is completely the opposite. It is not enough for their people to show pain when they see our children being killed in Israeli raids launched by American planes, nor does this serve the purpose. What they ought to do is change their governments which attack our countries. The hostility that America continues to express against the Muslim people has given rise to feelings of animosity on the part of Muslims against America and against the West in general. Those feelings of animosity have produced a change in the behavior of some crushed and subdued groups who, instead of fighting the Americans inside the Muslim countries, went on to fight them inside the United States of America itself. 
The Western regimes and the government of the United States of America bear the blame for what might happen. If their people do not wish to be harmed inside their very own countries, they should seek to elect governments that are truly representative of them and that can protect their interests. ...
The enmity between us and the Jews goes far back in time and is deep rooted. There is no question that war between the two of us is inevitable. For this reason it is not in the interest of Western governments to expose the interests of their people to all kinds of retaliation for almost nothing. It is hoped that people of those countries will initiate a positive move and force their governments not to act on behalf of other states and other sects. This is what we have to say and we pray to Allah to preserve the nation of Islam and to help them drive their enemies out of their land.
The leaders in America and in other countries as well have fallen victim to Jewish Zionist blackmail. They have mobilized their people against Islam and against Muslims. These are portrayed in such a manner as to drive people to rally against them. The truth is that the whole Muslim world is the victim of international terrorism, engineered by America at the United Nations. We are a nation whose sacred symbols have been looted and whose wealth and resources have been plundered. It is normal for us to react against the forces that invade our land and occupy it ... .Tell the Muslims everywhere that the vanguards of the warriors who are fighting the enemies of Islam belong to them and the young fighters are their sons. Tell them that the nation is bent on fighting the enemies of Islam. Once again, I have to stress the necessity of focusing on the Americans and the Jews for they represent the spearhead with which the members of our religion have been slaughtered. Any effort directed against America and the Jews yields positive and direct results - Allah willing. It is far better for anyone to kill a single American soldier than to squander his efforts on other activities. … This is difficult to understand, especially for him who does not understand the religion of Islam. In our religion, we believe that Allah has created us for the purpose of worshipping him. He is the one who has created us and who has favored us with this religion. Allah has ordered us to make holy wars and to fight to see to it that His word is the highest and the uppermost and that of the unbelievers the lowermost. We believe that this is the call we have to answer regardless of our financial capabilities. This too answers the claims of the West and of the secular people in the Arab world. They claim that this blessed awakening and the people reverting to Islam are due to economic factors. This is not so. It is rather a grace from Allah, a desire to embrace the religion of Allah. And this is not surprising. When the holy war called, thousands of young men from the Arab Peninsula and other countries answered the call and they came from wealthy backgrounds. Hundreds of them were killed in Afghanistan and in Bosnia and in ChechnyaWe do not care what the Americans believe. What we care for is to please Allah. Americans heap accusations on whoever stands for his religion or his rights or his wealth. ... It does not scare us that they have put a price on my head. We as Muslims believe that our years on this earth are finite and predetermined. If the whole world gets together to kill us before it is our time to go, they will not succeed. We also believe that livelihoods are preordained. So no matter how much pressure American puts on the regime in Riyadh to freeze our assets and to forbid people from contributing to this great cause, we shall still have Allah to take care of us; livelihood is sent by Allah; we shall not want. ...Allah has ordered us to glorify the truth and to defend Muslim land, especially the Arab peninsula ... against the unbelievers. After World War II, the Americans grew more unfair and more oppressive towards people in general and Muslims in particular. ... The Americans started it and retaliation and punishment should be carried out following the principle of reciprocity, especially when women and children are involved. Through history, American has not been known to differentiate between the military and the civilians or between men and women or adults and children. Those who threw atomic bombs and used the weapons of mass destruction against Nagasaki and Hiroshima were the Americans. Can the bombs differentiate between military and women and infants and children? America has no religion that can deter her from exterminating whole peoples. Your position against Muslims in Palestine is despicable and disgraceful. America has no shame. ... We believe that the worst thieves in the world today and the worst terrorists are the Americans. Nothing could stop you except perhaps retaliation in kind. We do not have to differentiate between military or civilian. As far as we are concerned, they are all targets, and this is what the fatwah says ... . The fatwah is general (comprehensive) and it includes all those who participate in, or help the Jewish occupiers in killing Muslims. After the explosion that took place in the World Trade Center, Ramzi Yousef became a well known Muslim figure. Muslims have come to know him. Unfortunately, I did not know him before this incident. I of course remember who he is. He is a Muslim who wanted to protect his religion jealously from the oppression practiced by America against Islam. He acted with zeal to make the Americans understand that their government was attacking Muslims in order to safeguard the American-Jewish interests. ...Wali Khan is a Muslim young man; his nickname in Afghanistan was the Lion. He was among the most courageous Muslim young men. He was a close friend and we used to fight from the same trenches in Afghanistan. We fought many battles against the Russians until they were defeated and put to shame and had to leave the country in disgrace. As to what you said about him working for me, I have nothing to say. We are all together in this; we all work for Allah and our reward comes from him. As to what you said about the attempt to assassinate President Clinton, it is not surprising. What do you expect from people attacked by Clinton, whose sons and mothers have been killed by Clinton? Do you expect anything but treatment by reciprocity? We have roused the nation and the Muslim people and we have communicated to them the fatwahs of our learned scholars who the Saudi government has thrown in jail in order to please the American government for which they are agents. ... We have communicated their fatwahs and stirred the nation to drive out the enemy who has occupied our land and usurped our country and suppressed our people and to rid the land of the two Holy Mosques from their presence. Among the young men who responded to our call are Khalid Al Said and Abdul Azeez Al... and Mahmud Al Hadi and Muslih Al Shamrani. We hope Allah receives them as holy martyrs. They have raised the nation's head high and washed away a great part of the shame that has enveloped us as a result of the weakness of the Saudi government and its complicity with the American government ... . Yes, we have instigated and they have responded. We hope Allah grants their families solace. As I have said, we are not interested in what America says. We do not care. We view ourselves and our brothers like everyone else. Allah created us to worship Him and to follow in his footsteps and to be guided by His Book. I am one of the servants of Allah and I obey his orders. Among those is the order to fight for the word of Allah ... and to fight until the Americans are driven out of all the Islamic countries.... Allah has granted the Muslim people and the Afghani mujahedeen, and those with them, the opportunity to fight the Russians and the Soviet Union. ... They were defeated by Allah and were wiped out. There is a lesson here. The Soviet Union entered Afghanistan late in December of '79. The flag of the Soviet Union was folded once and for all on the 25thof December just 10 years later. It was thrown in the waste basket. Gone was the Soviet union forever. We are certain that we shall - with the grace of Allah - prevail over the Americans and over the Jews, as the Messenger of Allah promised us in an authentic prophetic tradition when He said the Hour of Resurrection shall not come before Muslims fight Jews and before Jews hide behind trees and behind rocks. 
We are certain - with the grace of Allah - that we shall prevail over the Jews and over those fighting with them. Today however, our battle against the Americans is far greater than our battle was against the Russians. Americans have committed unprecedented stupidity. They have attacked Islam and its most significant sacrosanct symbols ... . We anticipate a black future for America. Instead of remaining United States, it shall end up separated states and shall have to carry the bodies of its sons back to America. 
History has the answer to your question. The fate of any government which sells the interests of its own people and, betrays the nation and commits offenses which furnish grounds for expulsion from Islam, is known. We expect for the ruler of Riyadh the same fate as the Shah of Iran. We anticipate this to happen to him and to the influential people who stand by him and who have sided with the Jews and the Christians giving them free reign over the land of the two Holy Mosques. These are grave offenses that are grounds for expulsion from the faith. They shall all be wiped outAfter our victory in Afghanistan and the defeat of the oppressors who had killed millions of Muslims, the legend about the invincibility of the superpowers vanished. Our boys no longer viewed America as a superpower. So, when they left Afghanistan, they went to Somalia and prepared themselves carefully for a long war. They had thought that the Americans were like the Russians, so they trained and prepared. They were stunned when they discovered how low was the morale of the American soldier. America had entered with 30,000 soldiers in addition to thousands of soldiers from different countries in the world. ... As I said, our boys were shocked by the low morale of the American soldier and they realized that the American soldier was just a paper tiger. He was unable to endure the strikes that were dealt to his army, so he fled, and America had to stop all its bragging and all that noise it was making in the press after the Gulf War in which it destroyed the infrastructure and the milk and dairy industry that was vital for the infants and the children and the civilians and blew up dams which were necessary for the crops people grew to feed their families. Proud of this destruction, America assumed the titles of world leader and master of the new world order. After a few blows, it forgot all about those titles and rushed out of Somalia in shame and disgrace, dragging the bodies of its soldiers. America stopped calling itself world leader and master of the new world order, and its politicians realized that those titles were too big for them and that they were unworthy of them. I was in Sudan when this happened. I was very happy to learn of that great defeat that America suffered, so was every MuslimAfter our victory over the Russians in Afghanistan, the international and the American mass media conducted fierce campaigns against us ... . They called us terrorists even before the mujahedeen had committed any act of terrorism against the real terrorists who are the Americans. On the other hand, we say that American politics and their religion do not believe in differentiating between civilians and military, between infants and animals, or among any human groups. ...
Our mothers and daughters and sons are slaughtered every day with the approval of America and its support. And, while America blocks the entry of weapons into Islamic countries, it provides the Israelis with a continuous supply of arms allowing them thus to kill and massacre more Muslims. Your religion does not forbid you from committing such acts, so you have no right to object to any response or retaliation that reciprocates your own actions. But, and in spite of this, our retaliation is directed primarily against the soldiers only and against those standing by them. Our religion forbids us from killing innocent people such as women and children. This, however, does not apply to women fighters. A woman who puts herself in the same trench with men, gets what they get
I say to them that they have put themselves at the mercy of a disloyal government, and this is most evident in Clinton's administration ... . We believe that this administration represents Israel inside America. Take the sensitive ministries such as the Ministry of Exterior and the Ministry of Defense and the CIA, you will find that the Jews have the upper hand in them. They make use of America to further their plans for the world, especially the Islamic world. American presence in the Gulf provides support to the Jews and protects their rear. And while millions of Americans are homeless and destitute and live in abject poverty, their government is busy occupying our land and building new settlements and helping Israel build new settlements in the point of departure for our Prophet's midnight journey to the seven heavens. America throws her own sons in the land of the two Holy Mosques for the sake of protecting Jewish interests. ...
The American government is leading the country towards hell. ... We say to the Americans as people and to American mothers, if they cherish their lives and if they cherish their sons, they must elect an American patriotic government that caters to their interests not the interests of the Jews. If the present injustice continues with the wave of national consciousness, it will inevitably move the battle to American soil, just as Ramzi Yousef and others have done. This is my message to the American people. I urge them to find a serious administration that acts in their interest and does not attack people and violate their honor and pilfer their wealth.
I am one of the servants of Allah. We do our duty of fighting for the sake of the religion of Allah. It is also our duty to send a call to all the people of the world to enjoy this great light and to embrace Islam and experience the happiness in Islam. Our primary mission is nothing but the furthering of this religion. ... Let not the West be taken in by those who say that Muslims choose nothing but slaughtering. Their brothers in East Europe, in Turkey and in Albania have been guided by Allah to submit to Islam and to experience the bliss of Islam. Unlike those, the European and the American people and some of the Arabs are under the influence of Jewish media. ..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrorist,"Our relationship with the Ansar al-Sunnah group is like our relationship with the other Islamic groups-a lose, cordial, and good relationship based on brotherhood in God. It is Muslims' duty toward their Muslim brothers. We harbor no hostility toward anyone or any Afghan groups. Our relationship with the Afghan mojahedin egan in 1399 Hijra (1979), namely when we went to Lahore, Pakistan, and worked with the Islamic group in Pakistan to support the mojahedin against the communist invasion. We have focused on helping the brothers in Afghanistan since 1985. We opened camps to train young men to fight the Soviet invasion. We cooperated with everyone to help Muslims to defend themselves and their religion, especially as the enemies of Islam want Muslims to remain weak and subservient. Our work in Afghanistan, which caused some people to insult us, was devoted to fighting the communist invasion and raising the banner that reads ``There is no other god but God.'' There are external quarters at which a finger of accusation could be pointed. They are the quarters spitefully hostile to Islam. They do not accept the natural right of Muslims to defend themselves. Our position in Afghanistan caused some of Islam's enemies o try to obstruct our cooperation with Muslims. The world tends to prefer to overlook the oppression and persecution in Bosnia and occupied Palestine and then hasten to accuse Muslims of terrorism if they defend themselves. It wants to keep Muslims weak and incapable of defending themselves. We also know that there are contacts among diplomats, all resigned to curb our movement and stop our contacts with our brothers. But we say that cooperation in piety is continuing among Muslims. There is a disagreement because of their rejection of our cooperation with the Islamic awakening, support f Muslim issues, and opposition to their restrictions on the all [al-da'wah] and the preachers. I am accused of supporting fundamentalism, even though everyone knows that this stems from our eagerness to raise the banner that reads ``There is no other god but God'' and support the Afghan mojahedin camps to fight oppression and communist aggression. I believe that all Muslims adopted this position; or that is what we believe was the case. The Egyptian press says that Usama Bin Ladin supports fundamentalism. We know that there are domestic problems in Egypt because of the state's violence against Islamists. Obviously there are bound to be reactions to this government policy. Like many other Muslim young men, some Islamists in Egypt gained military experience in the Afghan mojahedin amps. These conditions forced some to take such positions in their countries to defend their religion and themselves. The Egyptians are trying to indicate that I have something to do with the reactions taking place in their country. And hey accuse me of posing a threat to them. What I said about Egypt I say about Yemen, which I believe is one of the best Arab and Muslim countries in terms of adherence to traditions and the faith. Nevertheless, its citizens have been subjected to murder and religious persecution. So it is natural for reactions to take place, even if some of Yemen's sons do train in Afghan camps. The accusation that we support terrorism is a hostile, imperialist method designed to suppress Muslims' determination and paralyze their movement toward one another and toward their religion and faith. I visited Sudan for the first time in 1983, where acquainted myself with its agricultural capabilities and investment opportunities. Four years ago we came here to ooperate and work in the areas of road construction and agriculture. I inherited this type of work from my father, may God have mercy on him. At that time Afghanistan lacked everything. So I and other merchants agreed to help Afghanistan. We sent everything that the state needed. Due to the nature of our work, I and my Iranian friends decided to travel to and to stay in Afghanistan. In the beginning, we supplied the mujahidin camps with all their needs for medicine, food, and weapons. In Pakistan, I got acquainted with three Sudanese, who were members of the National Islamic Front [NIF] led by Hasan al-Turabi. NIF was not in power in Sudan yet. One of the three Sudanese was a young man named al-Tahir, a graduate of the engineering college of Khartoum University. Because he remained jobless for several years, he decided to volunteer for the mujahidin ranks in Afghanistan. AlTahir was very bright and polite. He convinced me to invest my funds in Sudanese projects. The al-Bashir-al-Turabi coup then took place in 1989. At that time, I became well-known among the mujahidin, especially the Arab and Muslim ones. 'Abdallah 'Azzam and two of his sons were killed in a car bomb explosion in Peshawar in October 1989. I felt my life was in danger. With the beginning of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, we mujahidin felt that there were attempts to liquidate the symbols of `Islamic Jihad,' especially as the information available to us indicated that the Mosad was behind the assassination of Shaykh 'Abdallah 'Azzam, who was a Palestinian. To put it simply, the Bin Ladin Establishment's aid covers 13 countries, including Albania, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Netherlands, Britain, Romania, Russia, Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq, and some Gulf countries which there is no need to mention. This aid, comes in particular from the Human Concern International Society, which was founded in Afghanistan in 1982. It is possible, but I do not live in Sudan now. I keep moving and I do not stay permanently in any country."" He adds: ""In general, Sudan needs me more than I need it. I can assure you that my departure from Sudan will inevitably lead to the collapse of the Sudanese economy. What is happening is a mixture of religion and organized crime. It is God that we thank and it is God whose help and forgiveness we seek and whose name we uphold against our own evil and our wrongdoings. Whoever is guided by God cannot be misled and whoever misleads can find no guidance. I declare that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is his subject and messenger. ""O ye who believe, fear God as he should be feared and die not except in a state of Islam,"" ""O mankind, reverence your Guardian-Lord who created you from a single person, created, of like nature, his mate and from them twain scattered (like seeds) countless men and women; reverence God, through whom ye demand your mutual (rights) and (reverence) the wombs (that bore you) for God ever watches over you,"" ""O ye who believe, fear God and (always) say a word directed to the right, that he may make your conduct whole and sound and forgive you your sins. He that obeys God and his apostle has already attained the highest achievement."" [Koranic verses] Thank God who said: ""And reform is my only aim and only God can grant me success. On him I depend and in him I believe."" And thank God who said: ""Ye are the best of peoples evolved for mankind, enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and believing in God."" [Koranic verses] Prayers and peace be upon his Prophet who said: ""People who see an unjust person and do nothing are about to be punished by God."" You are not unaware of the injustice, repression, and aggression that have befallen Muslims through the alliance of Jews, Christians, and their agents, so much so that Muslims' blood has become the cheapest blood and their money and wealth are plundered by the enemies. Your blood has been spilled in Palestine and Iraq. The image of that dreadful massacre in Qana, Lebanon, is still vivid in one's mind, and so are the massacres in Tajikistan, Burma, Kashmir, Assam, the Philippines, Fatani [as transliterated], Ogaden, Somalia, Eritrea, Chechnya, and Bosnia-Herzegovina where hair-raising and revolting massacres were committed before the eyes of the entire world clearly in accordance with a conspiracy by the United States and its allies who banned arms for the oppressed there under the cover of the unfair United Nations. That alerted Muslims to the fact that they are the main target of the Jewish-crusade alliance aggression, and all the false claims about human rights fell under the blows and massacres committed against Muslims everywhere. The latest aggression was one of the worst catastrophes to befall the Muslims since the death of the Prophet, may God's prayers and blessings be upon him. It was the occupation of the land of the two holy mosques [Saudi Arabia], the cradle of Islam, the scene of the revelation, the source of the message, and the site of the holy Ka'bah, the qiblah [to which Muslims turn in prayer] of all Muslims, by Christian armies of the Americans and their allies. God is the source of all power. In the light of the reality we are going through and the blessed, sweeping awakening in the world at large and in the Islamic world in particular, I meet with you today after a long absence dictated by the unjust crusade campaign led by the United States against the ulema and advocates of Islam to prevent them from instigating the Islamic nation against its enemies, as did their predecessors, may God have mercy on their souls, such as IbnTaymiyah and al-'Izz Ibn-'Abd-al-Salam. And so, this Jewish-crusade alliance killed and detained the symbols of the truthful ulema and upholders of the call—and God is above everyone. It killed the mujahid Shaykh 'Abdallah 'Azzam and detained the mujahid Shaykh Ahmad Yasin in the land from which the Prophet, may God's prayers and blessings be upon him, ascended to heaven, and the mujahid Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman in the United States. And, at the behest of the United States, a very large number of ulema, advocates of the call, and youth were arrested in the land of the two holy mosques. Prominent among them are Shaykh Salman al-'Awdah, Shaykh Safar alHawali, and their brother. Help comes from God who is the source of all power. We were affected by that injustice in that we were prevented from addressing Muslims and were pursued in Pakistan, Sudan, and Afghanistan. Hence that long absence, but, thanks be t God, a safe base was found in Khorasan [Afghanistan], on the soil of the Hindu Kush where, thanks be to God, the largest heretic power on earth was destroyed and where the superpower myth vanished in the face of the mujahidin's outcry of Allah Akbar [God is great]. Today, from the same land, from Afghanistan, we seek to end the injustice which has befallen the nation at the hands of the Jewish-crusade alliance, especially after the occupation of the land of the ascension of the Prophet [now Israel], may God's prayers and blessings be upon him, and the violation of the land of the two holy mosques. We beseech God to give us victory, for that is in his hands and he is capable of granting it. Today we begin to talk, work, and discuss ways of rectifying what has befallen the Islamic world in general and the land of the two holy mosques in particular. We want to study the ways which could be used to rectify matters and restore rights to their owners as people have been subjected to grave danger and harm to their religion and their lives, people of all walks of life, civilians, military, security men, employees, merchants, people big and small, school and university students, and unemployed university graduates, in fact hundreds of thousands who constitute a broad sector of the society. The same thing has befallen the people in industry and in agriculture, the cities and villages, and the people in the desert and the rural areas. Everyone is complaining about almost everything. The situation in the land of the two holy mosques is like a gigantic volcano about to erupt and destroy heresy and corruption, whatever their source. The explosions of Riyadh and al-Khubar were only a small indication of that torrential flood resulting from the bitter suffering, repression, coercion, great injustice, disgraceful debauchery, and poverty. People have been greatly preoccupied with matters of their livelihood. Talk of economic decline, high prices, massive debts, and overcrowded prisons is widespread and endless in society. Low-income employees will talk to you about their debts running to tens and hundreds of thousands of riyals. They complain about the massive and continuing drop in the purchasing power of the riyal in comparison with most other major currencies. Major traders and contractors will talk to you about the debts owed to them by the state running to hundreds of millions and even billions of riyals, increasing daily as a result of rates of usury. The state's internal debts to the public have reached more than 340 billion riyals, not to mention the foreign debts. People are wondering: Is ours really the largest oil exporting country? They feel that God is tormenting them because they kept quiet about the regime's injustice and illegitimate actions, especially its failure to have recourse to the Shari'ah, its confiscation of people's legitimate rights, the opening of the land of the two holy mosques to the American occupiers, and the arbitrary jailing of the true ulema, heirs of the Prophets. Good people who specialize in matters of religion, such as propagators of Islam and ulema, as well as experts in earthly matters such as traders, economists, and dignitaries, became alert to that affliction and each group did its best to act quickly to remedy the situation. Everyone agrees that the country is moving towards a deep abyss and a terrible calamity the extent of which only God knows. As one major businessman said, ""the king is leading the country to 60 calamities."" God is the source of all help and power. Many princes share the public's concern and privately voice opposition to what is going on in the country in terms of terror, repression, and corruption. The rivalry between princes overseeing their own personal interests has ruined the country and the regime has destroyed its legitimacy with its own hands through many actions, the most important being: 1. Its suspension of the Islamic Shari'ah laws, replacing them with temporal laws, and its bloody confrontation with the truthful ulema and good youth—and God is above everyone. 2. Its failure to protect the country, opening it to the nation's enemies, the American crusader forces who have become the main cause of all aspects of our plight, especially the economic aspect as a result of the unjustified heavy expenditure on them and as a result of the policies they impose on the country, and particularly the oil policy determining the quantities of oil to be produced and setting the prices which suit their own economic interests ignoring the country's economic interests, and also as a result of the exorbitant arms deals imposed on the regime, to the point that people are wondering what good, then, is the regime? So, each group has made efforts to act quickly and evade the danger. They offered advice secretly and openly, in verse and in prose, singly and in groups, and they sent petition after petition and memorandum after memorandum. They left no stone unturned and there was no influential person they did not include in their reformist moves. In their writings they applied the gentle and lenient method of wisdom and good advice calling for reform and penance for the major wrongdoings and corruption that transgressed the categorical religious limits and the public's legitimate rights. Most regrettably, however, the only response they got from the regime was rejection, disregard, and ridicule. The matter did not stop at the point of just humiliating them but that was followed by greater and greater misdeeds throughout the land of the two holy mosques. Therefore, silence was no longer appropriate and overlooking the facts was no longer acceptable. When the excesses intensified and went beyond the limits of simple wrongdoings and misdeeds to violation of the clear basis of Islam, a group of ulema and religious preachers grew tired of the deafening sound of misguidance and injustice and the suffocating smell of corruption. So signs of rejection appeared and voices were raised calling for reform to remedy the situation and stop the rot. They were joined by hundreds of intellectuals, dignitaries, merchants, and former officials. They submitted petitions and memoranda to the king urging reform. In the Hegira year of 1411 during the Gulf war, a petition signed by about 400 figures was submitted to the king calling for rectification of the situation in the country and for an end to the injustice to the public, but he ignored the advice and ridiculed those who offered it, and the situation got worse. Those who had offered the advice then sent more memoranda and petitions, the most important being the advice memorandum handed to the king in the month of Muharram 1413 Hegira which diagnosed the disease and prescribed the medicine with a sound Shari'ah approach and in a sound scientific way. It dwelt on the major gaps in the regime's philosophy and the main anomalies in the regime's foundations, pointing to the suffering of society's symbols and leaders calling for reform, such as the ulema, religious protagonists, tribal shaykhs, merchants, dignitaries, and university professors, who were marginalized, neutralized, and even pursued and harassed. It also dwelt on the country's laws and regulations and what they allowed and disallowed against God's will. It discussed the state of the media in the country which became means for the advancement of individuals and relatives and for obliterating facts, falsifying the truth, defaming righteous people, and shedding crocodile tears for the nation's causes to mislead people without any serious action and to implement the enemies' plans to corrupt people, draw them away from their religion, and spread sin among the believers. ""Those who love (to see) scandal published and broadcast among the believers will have a grievous penalty in this life and in the hereafter. God knows and ye know not"". It discussed the people's violated legitimate rights and the administrative situation with all its inefficiency and corruption. It pointed to the state's financial and economic situation and the terrible and frightful fate in store as a result of the debts of usury which have broken the state's back, and to the waste which has squandered the nation's wealth to satisfy personal wealth, resulting in taxes, duties, and excises imposed on the public. The Prophet, may God's prayers and blessings be upon him, said about the woman who sinned, repented, and was dealt with accordingly: ""She repented and if one who imposes taxes repented in the same way he would be forgiven."" That reflects the magnitude of the sin of the tax man, but some are publicly and over loudspeakers applauding him and his massive and permitted usury, but that is heresy. Reliance is on God who is the source of all power. It exposed the despicable state of the social utilities in the country, which became even worse after the memorandum, and especially the water services, the most important element of livelihood. It discussed the state of the Army whose small numbers, poor training, and inefficient command were exposed by the Gulf crisis, despite the astronomical and unreasonable figures which had been mentioned and could not remain a secret. On justice and the courts, the memorandum showed that numerous Shari'ah laws had been suspended and replaced with temporal laws. On the state's foreign policy, the memorandum exposed that policy's failures and disregard for Muslim causes and even support and backing for the enemies. The GazaJericho and the case of the communists in southern Yemen are not too distant examples, and there are many others. Upholding temporal laws and supporting heretics against Muslims are prohibited in Islam, as the ulema have ruled. God said ""whoever does not rule by God's law is a heretic,"" and He said: ""But no, by the Lord, they can have no (real) faith until they make thee judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction"". Although the memorandum submitted all that leniently and gently, as a reminder of God and as good advice in a gentle, objective, and sincere way, despite the importance and necessity of advice for rulers in Islam, and despite the number and positions of the signatories of the memorandum and their sympathizers, it was of no avail. Its contents were rejected and its signatories and sympathizers were humiliated, punished, and imprisoned. The preachers' and reformers' eagerness to pursue peaceful reform methods in the interest of the country's unity and to prevent bloodshed was clearly demonstrated. So why should the regime block all means of peaceful reform and drive the people toward armed action? That was the only door left open to the public for ending injustice and upholding right and justice, and in whose interests do Prince Sultan and Prince Nayif plunge the country and the people into an internal war that would destroy everything, enlisting the aid and advice of those who fomented internal sedition in their country and using the people's police force to put down the reform movement there and pit members of the public one against the other—leaving the main enemy in the region, namely the Jewish-American alliance, safe and secure, having found such traitors to implement its policies aimed at exhausting the nation's human and financial resources internally. The person whom Interior Minister Prince Nayif is consulting was not tolerated in his own country because of his extreme dirt and affront to his people. He was dismissed from his post but came to be received by Prince Nayif with open arms, for cooperation on sin and aggression. He filled the prisons with the nation's best sons, bringing tears to the eyes of the mothers whose sons were jailed unfairly. Does the regime want to pit the public, civilians and military, against one another as was the case in some neighboring countries? I have no doubt that that is the policy of the Israeli American enemy alliance, the main beneficiary of all that. But, thank God, the vast majority of the people, civilians and military, are aware of that sinister plan and will not allow themselves to be an instrument for strikes against one another in implementation of the policy of the main enemy, namely the Israeli-American alliance, through the Saudi regime, its agent in the country. That is why everyone agrees that ""a crooked stick cannot have a straight shadow"" and that there must be concentration on hitting the main enemy who has thrust the nation into whirlpools and labyrinths for decades since dividing it into states and statelets. Whenever a reform movement appears in the Islamic states, that Jewish-crusade alliance pushes its agents in the region, the rulers, to exhaust and abort such a reform movement by various suitable means, sometimes aborting it by luring it to armed confrontation, for which it chooses the time and place and through which it would nip it in the bud. Sometimes he would set loose his men in the Interior Ministry, who had graduated from Shari'ah colleges, to confuse and undermine the reform march and to draw the nation and the people away from that march, sometimes luring some righteous men to enter into a war of words with the ulema and the symbols of the reform movement to exhaust everyone's energy and keep the great heresy in control of the nation, misleading it and continuing the peripheral discussions while the worship of God and adherence to his Shari'ah are absent in reality. In these discussions and responses right and wrong get mixed up and often lead to personal enmities, with some people taking sides, thereby further dividing and weakening the nation, so that Islamic action priorities disappear. One should beware of these and similar diabolical tricks by the Interior Ministry. The appropriate behavior in such cases is what has been advised by the ulema, such as what the late Shaykh al-Islam Ibn-Taymiyah said, namely that all Muslims should join hands in warding off the great heresy controlling the Islamic world while sustaining minimum damage to prevent the greater damage which is in the fact the great heresy. When duties are numerous the most important takes priority. It is no secret that warding off that American enemy is the top duty after faith, and nothing should take priority over it, as decreed by the ulema. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn-Taymiyah said: ""Fighting in self-defense is the strongest way of warding off harm to honor and religion, and it is a collective duty. Warding off an enemy who corrupts religion and the world is a top duty after faith. It is unconditional and is done according to means."" If warding off that aggressive enemy becomes impossible without all Muslims of all walks and ranks getting together, then that is their duty and they should in that case overlook some disputed issues. Overlooking such disputes at this stage is less harmful than continuation of the great heresy afflicting the countries of the Muslims. That is why Shaykh al-Islami, explaining that matter, pointed out a main and great principle which should be taken into account, which is that work should concentrate on warding off the greater of the two evils. Referring to the state of the mujahidin and Muslims, he said that if among them there happened to be very sinful soldiers, that would not justify abandoning the jihad against the aggressive enemy. After discussing the case of the Tatars and their change of God's laws, he, may God have mercy on his soul, said that ""agreement on fighting them fully would please God, uphold his word, and establish his religion and obedience to his Prophet. If some among them happen to be sinful and ill intentioned, fighting for leadership or offending others on some matters, and if the religious harm of not fighting them is greater than the harm of fighting them, then the duty is to fight them to ward off the greater harm. That is why one of the principles of the Sunnah and the group is to do conquest using every good as well as sinful person, for God supports this in the interest of the cause of religion because, as the Prophet, may God's prayers and blessings be upon him, said, if conquest can only be achieved with the help of sinful princes or very sinful soldiers, then one of two things must be done: Either abandon the conquest with their cooperation, which means the greater harm of others taking over, or proceed with the conquest along with the sinful princes, and that way the greater harm is avoided and most of the rules of Islam are established, if not all. That would be the duty in that case and in all similar cases. In fact many of the conquests which took place after the orthodox caliphs took place in that way."" What is necessary in such a case is that everyone should do his best to incite and mobilize the nation against the aggressive enemy and the great heresy prevailing in the country and corrupting religion and life. There is no greater duty after faith than warding [daf'] off [that enemy], namely the Israeli-American alliance occupying the land of the two holy mosques and the land of the ascension of the Prophet, may God's prayers and blessings be upon him. The Muslims are reminded that they should avoid infighting between sons of the Muslim nation because that will have dire consequences, the most important being: 1. Exhaustion of human resources ""as most of the casualties and victims would be from the Muslim people."" 2. Exhaustion of financial resources. 3. Destruction of the state's infrastructure. 4. Disintegration of society. 5. Destruction of the oil industries, because the presence of the crusader and American military forces in the Islamic Gulf states, on land, in the air, and at sea, represents the greatest danger and harm and the greatest threat to the largest oil reserves in the world. That presence is a provocation to the people and an affront to their religion, feelings, and dignity, and has driven them toward armed struggle against the occupying invaders. A spread of fighting in these areas would carry the danger of the oil burning which would be detrimental to the economic interests of the Gulf states and the land of the two holy mosques, and in fact to the world economy. Here we pause and urge our brothers the people, the mujahidin, to preserve that wealth and not to involve it in the battle because it is a great Islamic wealth and a great and important economic power for the coming Islamic state, God willing. We also firmly warn the aggressive United States against burning that Islamic wealth at the end of the war for fear of it falling into the hands of its legitimate owners and to harm its economic rivals in Europe and the Far East, especially Japan, which is considered the main consumer of the region's oil. 6.

Terrorist,"In July 2013, a bobcat living in a filthy rusted cage was liberated from the clutches of an aspiring fur farmer. The animal was never recaptured — a victory in the war against wildlife.

For this and other actions on behalf of fur-bearing animals I would later be arrested by a team of FBI agents and sent to federal prison.

This is what the U.S. Government calls terrorism.

The communique read:

“In the early morning hours of July 27, the Animal Liberation Front visited the
property of Shelli Frazier in the town of Plains, Montana, completely surrounded by the beautiful Lolo National Forest.

Frazier applied in 2006 for a permit to imprison bobcats on her property in a fur farm that she hoped would eventually grow to sixty cats.

Despite already making a living breeding horses, she perhaps felt that this could be a lucrative side business. We arrived at her unpublished address determined to correct her mistake, and watch her investments run free into the wilderness.

Exploration of the site revealed that the force of economics had already precluded any need for the force of boltcutters – strewn about this disgusting and decrepit property were large empty cages, the rusted remains of Shelli Frazier’s dreams.

It was not until we checked every single run in an empty cat hutch tucked at the back of the northern lot that we found the tragic consequences of her business ineptitude. In one of the runs, huddling against the back wall, surrounded by rotting food, mildewed wood, and his own feces, was a lone bobcat.

The sight of a creature so majestic in a state so pathetic cannot be done justice
with words. We have yet been unable to determine why Frazier kept him and him alone, but if it was a sense of sentimentality, it certainly was not evident from his
treatment. Emaciated and filthy, his beauty was evident even through the matted fur and traumatized stare, with his bushy jowls and black ear tufts. To be in such proximity to this creature, staring into his haunting yellow eyes, changed every member of our cell. We could only speculate as to how he had suffered and what he had seen, but we could know with certainty that he deserved a shot at freedom. We opened his cage and left.

Shelli Frazier is not the only cruel human ever to keep such noble cats in tiny cages in Lolo National Forest.

More than two decades ago, Rodney Coronado visited Cole MacPherson’s bobcat prison in the town of Lolo just an hour’s drive south of Plains. MacPherson’s farm was Frazier’s fantasy – a shed of sixty pacing, neurotic, traumatized large cats. Though he was forced to close shop around 2005, the ALF still keeps tabs on MacPherson – today, he continues his dental practice in Missoula. This should be a lesson to Frazier. If you ever again hold wild creatures captive on your land, we will breach it to free them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrorist,"Endless twelve hours have passed too quickly. He lit a cigarette, looked around in the bus: faces, eyes… what do they express? Everything but fear. It is time to leave now.

The early morning of July 21st, in the hotel room 430 was pretty calm. ‘I can’ and ‘I want’ fully charged his will, which had a tough challenge on that day. Every thought born out of faint-heartedness was detected and strangled. The arrows on the clock approached seven, a can of Redbull with a cigarette were finished for breakfast. He did not care anymore about the time on the clock, perhaps this happens with everyone, who dives into the ‘here and now’. The only time he needed, precisely a single moment of it, was the moment of clarity, the point of no return.

The web uploaded his video, where he appears with an AK-47 calling: ‘Happy Anti-System Day! Do not deceive yourself, celebrate the truth’.

He took three grenades from the closet and put them together with the gun in the backpack. A revolver and another training grenade were in the little shoulder bag. The third bag had everything else that could have been needed: from medicines to a mock bomb. The window in the room overlooked the central square – the place, where the action is set to take place, and granite Lesya Ukrainka [Ukrainian Poetess – Akmal] will be forced to witness it. Will she let him in? ‘Yes’, he said out loud.

The evening before he was asking himself questions such as whom and what should he remember in the last, perhaps, hours of his life? Some events, people… Not so many people, but dogs, whom he loved, and with the love of which he saved himself. ‘Do not limp’, he said to himself, and by the effort of will stopped thinking. Sleep had to be the answer to all questions.



The taxi arrived quickly. He did not leave the key from the room at the front desk, to make them think he is going to come back. There were only few people in the bus station; he sat on one of the benches along the platform. There were two conditions when choosing the transport: no children and at least ten passengers inside. He got on a couple of buses, but it was not what he needed. Half an hour later, a blue, transit bus ‘the Etalon’ with more passengers had arrived. He went to look inside and asked what time is the departure. It was perfect timing. With the bags he occupied two seats in back of the bus. ‘The Etalon’ drove off and the countdown now went on for minutes. As soon as the bus left the station, he hanged the automatic gun and the grenades on himself, the revolver was on the side and a bag with the mock bomb on top was put in the passage. The bus stopped and two people got on in medical masks. As soon as the bus moved again, he went to the driver and said: ‘The bus is mined, all stay where you are. Driver, go to the Central Square’ and shot up. All thirteen hostages heard it clearly, but could not yet understand, believe it. He wanted to think it was just a dream. He threw handcuffs to the driver and said: ‘Fasten your left hand to the wheel, turn to the Theater square, come close to the Lesya Ukrainka monument right in front of the police station and turn off the engine’. An old woman in the front seat started to wail and pray fervently, later he will give her a sedative pill. The driver asked to unfasten the handcuffs because his hand was too pressured – he unfasten. The doors were blocked from inside with plastic ties. It’s time to call the police.

‘I am Maxim Plokhoi, I have a bus full of people on the Theatre Square. I have grenades, a machine gun and a bomb with me. Another crowded place in the city is also mined. The video message with my demands is published on my social networks’ accounts. Nobody should be 50 meters around me’.

The demands uploaded to the internet were: the heads of the courts, prisons, police, Ukrainian intelligence service, Parliament and ministries of Defence and Justice, the prime-minister, the oligarchs and the heads of the churches (he named them all) to post a video, where they admit: ‘I am the real terrorist’; the president to post a video ‘all watch the film ‘Earthlings’.

He then told the hostages to call their families to ask them to engage with the media. First police cars stopped 20 meters away from the bus. Several indirect shots through the windows made the police understand the seriousness of what was happening. Later, prior to shooting, he will ask the hostages to cover their ears. A woman asked:

‘Release the child!’.
‘What child?’ – he asked in bewilderment.

She pointed with her gaze at the masked young lad who got on the bus at the bus stop. He was 15. ‘My son is 15 too’, he said and thought: ‘From 14 on, one can be jailed, then it is not a child anymore’.

The negotiator called for the first time. ‘Meet the demands or I will blow it up’, he growled into the phone.

He met the driver’s eyes in the mirror. Every day he is responsible for hundreds of passengers’ lives: they are also his hostages. And when they die because of him, no one dares to declare him a terrorist. He remembered his mother. Seven years have passed. That morning she left on the same ‘Etalon’ and died. What was thinking that voluntary hostage in her last minutes? Perhaps of her son, who had just three months to be released from the prison? He was watching covered bodies in a report from the scene of the accident on the barracks’ TV on that day. The state is the standard of lies and violence, where power is the driver; law-abiding citizens are voluntary hostages and offenders are violent hostages. Sometimes the buses crash into each other with hundreds and millions of victims, but drivers are not terrorists. Why is that so? Where is the justice to be taken? The answer is: to create your own! To create by the maximal action…

Phone calls returned him to reality. Reporters were bombarding him with questions. ‘Come here, look at and listen to’, he told them, realizing that the more cameras are around the less is the chance for the law enforcement to storm the bus. The General got into the role of a negotiator and started stalling. ‘Where is the president? I am waiting for his videomessage’, – that was, what the General heard.

A young woman was holding her stomach.

‘What?’, he asked.
‘I am pregnant, 4th month’.

Visually nothing could be seen. He reassured her as best he could and offered some water and pills. The old woman became quiet: the pills worked. He noticed a shooter hiding 20 meters away. He threw one grenade with the pin half bent towards the shooter through the broken window and told to the General: ‘Send your men to clear it and remove the shooter, I will make sure the grenade explodes in 30 minutes’. The second grenade indeed exploded in half an hour. Hundred meters away from the bus a curious uniformed crowd got out of the police department; – ‘They got too relaxed’, he thought and fired with a short burst up. ‘Don’t shoot, we are doing everything possible! The president was briefed, the minister is here’, chattered the General.

Half of the day had passed; he heard some incomprehensible buzzing over the bus. Through a gap in the open hatch, he saw a drone hovering with a large camera lens. He fired four times from the gun and the revolver, not a single bullet hit. He realized it was a distraction; closed the hatches and looked around. He thought that, if there is an assault, there will be victims that are killed by the Special Forces, but they will say that he killed them. ‘I don’t want blood, I want truth. Do not fear.’ he said to the hostages and shortly added: “It is symbolic that we are right beside the monument to a woman who said ‘One who freed himself, shall be free”.

He chose a perfect place – for many hours the traffic in the centre was paralyzed and hundred meters away stands the cathedral, the theological seminary, where he came 28 years ago in search of the truth. Fifteen out these 28 years he spent in prisons. This cathedral, not the bus, should have been the scene of action, scene of his truth. Because of the lockdown, the cathedral was closed, but he could not wait anymore. He was telling all this to the hostages, they got curious, started asking questions and he was willing to answer them. He wanted them to understand him, to understand what he dared to understand. Last years he was asking himself a question, how to live a day if one knows it is the last one? It was necessary to answer this question, because he realized that the only way to live is to live as if every day is your last day, otherwise it is not worth to live, otherwise it is a lie. Today there was no lie; there was an awful truth. He wanted the hostages to become free of fear, not the fear of him – they did not fear him anymore, – but the fear of being honest.

They run out of water. He called the General and asked to bring some more. The police officer who brought food and water decided to stick his head in the bus to capture more information. A shot over his head brought him to his senses.

The hostages became more talkative and indignant: ‘is it really that hard for the president to record one video clip?’. The General said that the president is in Switzerland and having a reception afterwards, he was clearly stalling: more than 10 hours have passed.

All those serving sentences in camps and prisons of the state did not steal a hundredth part of what any of the oligarchs on his list did; tens of thousands of convicts combined did not kill, maim, or break the fate of as many as did it on ‘legal grounds’ every second of his list. Ministers, priests, politicians, oligarchs, jailers – they have millions of citizens as hostages, and the larger and stronger the state system, the more claims to world domination, – the greater ‘legal terrorist’ the state is. Ten hours have passed and no one of them called and said, ‘release one of the hostages and I will comply to your request’. The embassy of Switzerland received his call: ‘Tell the president that Plokhoi and the hostages are waiting for his videomessage’.

Man is not a king of the nature, he is its terrorist, the murderer of all living; this is what the film ‘Earthlings’ is about. The demand to the president was a priority. The demands to the others – rhetorical, i.e. self-sustained and not requiring a response, a reaction. Why he is doing that? ‘So I need’, his conscience was replying to that; it was conscience, which paralyzed his instinct of self-preservation and made the instinct of justice the main one. He reloaded the revolver, changed the clip of the machine gun. The sun was saying goodbye to the sky over the square. Everyone was breathing the air of uncertainty. He approached the window and was just going to fire a burst in the sky, but a sudden phone call stopped him. The General said that he is going to hand the phone to the president. ‘I will post the videomessage if you release three hostages’. He thought for a second and replied: ‘I am releasing three of them now, you post the message and after half an hour I get out unarmed and release everybody’. One could hear the president joyfully surprised. When the old woman, the adolescent and the pregnant were leaving the bus they heard his ‘I am sorry’; later he will say ‘I am sorry’ again to the rest of them.

Why did he decide to release everyone? He knew they needed more drastic actions, they needed blood; that wasn’t in his script. ‘I made it,’ he said aloud, and put the safety on the gun. ‘It will not take long until each of you will understand that you got more freedom inside you’, he said to the hostages.

It was a long way to this day, and just three steps left; ‘there is no death’, he thought stepping on the tired body of the square.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrorist,"For purposes of this essay, I ask that the dozen or so people still concerned about Animal Liberation humor me and assume two facts:

Covid-19 has killed 100s of 1000s of people and; and,
Wearing a mask is an effective method of protecting oneself & others.
I have no doubt that this zoonotic disease is real and has devastated a lot of people. (Although not a single human has been affected anywhere close to the devastation we regularly & carelessly visit upon our nonhuman brethren.) I personally know a few people who’ve been diagnosed and expired shortly thereafter, many more who showed no symptoms or fully recovered. And debating whether those who jumped from a plane without a parachute are included in the fatality stats or whether it’s some asinine new world order conspiracy are distractions. Whether one is right-leaning or left-leaning tends to influence whether they view the current coronavirus as a threat to liberty or a threat to life itself, respectively. Let me clear this up: the only threat is the one we pose to the animal nations. The simple fact is that, no matter where one falls on the political spectrum, they’re likely an integral & active part of our Pandemic Culture.

I challenge anyone to name a recent pandemic that was not zoonotic in nature; that is, that did not directly result from humans destroying wildlife habitats & decimating our natural barriers or by eating animals. Go ahead, I’ll wait… mad cow, ebola, bird flu, swine flu, SARS… nope, I can’t think of any either; but you can get back to me. In fact, you can discount me as a fanatic or extremist, but you may not dismiss the Brookings Institute as easily:

“The devastation wrought by COVID-19 underscores the need for measures to minimize the chances of another zoonotic pandemic. That means radically changing how humans interact with wildlife and natural habitats, preserving terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity, and overhauling food production. Otherwise, another contagion originating from animals could arrive at any time, compounding the disastrous legacy of COVID-19.”

For 43 years, I believed that drinking cow’s milk was natural and healthy & that stuffing bread up a murdered turkey’s anal cavity was a festive way to celebrate family. I wasn’t told that heart disease was a wholly-avoidable leading cause of death. Nor was I aware that high cholesterol, obesity, late-onset diabetes and a host of other standard diseases were caused by eating animals. Like everyone else, I simply learned that big-pharma drugs would alleviate the symptoms. Now we have covid. Same system, different sickness. And while the morning news has catchy little segments like “vaccination nation,” no one is telling us the truth. We are all responsible.

I’m guessing that neither Sean Hannity nor Rachel Maddow got on their respective soap boxes recently to rail against our culture’s complicity in creating zoonotic illnesses. Every single person who continues to eat, wear, or otherwise use animal products is utterly delusional and sickeningly entitled to demand that others wear facial petri dishes to protect them while they actively cultivate yet the next pandemic. Every medium promotes the absurdity that we’re all in this together and most appear to have digested it without question. Sorry to rain on everyone’s animal exploitation parade, but, as long as our culture embraces a wholesale animal holocaust, I’m not in this with anyone but your nonhuman victims… and we all reap what we sew.

So, then, vegans get a free pass, right? Nah, not exactly. Every single vegan who finally crawled out from hiding under the table in 2020 to throw their alleged convictions and the nonhumans under a bus, advocated for animal-torture vaccines, and unabashedly began publicly worshipping the nation’s top vivisector, the degenerate Anthony Fauci, is a special kind of loathsome human-supremacist hypocrite. Maybe they can find one of those equally-useless animal rights philosophers with whom to discuss their new utilitarian bent. In the meantime, I suggest these vegans go find themselves one of those magnanimous vivisectors who are offering all kinds of rewards if they’ll sign up to be human vivisection subjects for their vaccine. Go on, get your dna tweaked. It’ll be fine. And I can hardly think of anyone more deserving.

I thought I’d come to terms with the fact that I live in an insane society a long time ago – we murder the innocent for profit, wear skins torn off their bleeding bodies for style, and eat their remains three times a day while giving thanks to some deity. We sing songs about peace on earth while carving up a pig whose last bloody screams on this earth were ignored. And then when our selfish perversions come back and only begin to give the human race back an infinitesimal iota of the karmic retribution we so justly deserve, we turn our fear and hatred on people who won’t wear on a diaper on their face?! Mutating our RNA and petri dish masks is a solution? That this makes sense to any single individual is incomprehensible. We’ve gone beyond insanity to full-blown social psychosis.

So next time you want to leer at my bare face in a supermarket from behind your mask while you’re grazing in a frozen cemetery or deli case of dismembered animals, I invite you to approach me so we can have a cozy little face-to-face chat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrorist,"That the human species is an utter plague to the natural order is indisputable. With carefree disregard, we devastate the planet and enslave our nonhuman brethren — the depth and scope of our crimes both unfathomable and incalculable. And every single one of us is stained by the genocide in which we are all complicit. Yes, vegans too. Removing ourselves from the equation of death did nothing to absolve us of our sins; furthermore, we tacitly approve and tolerate a society bathed in blood. I know of no vegan who walks around kicking people in the kneecaps when they graze in the frozen cemeteries at supermarkets. While I’ve done it on occasion, we don’t generally walk around cutting the lines of those who fish — cowards who jam hooks through the faces of unsuspecting animals for fun. We’re still complicit.

Enter SARS-CV-2. The governments of the world are not at all concerned if the masses are thinned, so the hysteria around this virus and the draconian, militaristic social controls being implemented are far more troublesome than the pandemic. I propose everyone resume normal life, go out there and catch our coronavirus, build our immunities or drop dead. Let our infrastructure get overwhelmed, let our artificial and unsustainable social constructs collapse, and, as a close friend observed, maybe revert to an agrarian society. I couldn’t care less where any human falls on this issue, but I challenge anyone to argue that a swift kick in our privilege — a leveling out of the almighty human species — is not a positive development for the animal kingdom we’ve eviscerated.

Every health “crisis” in recent memory has resulted from a contagion jumping species — mad cow, bird flu, swine flu, ebola, sars, covid (or sars2) — purely by virtue of humans believing we’re entitled to to satiate our deviate penchants at their expense. We’ve earned karmic justice, whether or not this one turns out to be anything close. And as far as our nonhuman victims are concerned, Covid is not nearly deadly enough. I don’t expect our arrogance and hubris to recede after this year’s pandemic subsides, so let’s take bets on from where our next gut punch to our human privilege will come. Cow’s milk? Sealife? Unfertilized chicken eggs? I won’t cry when the inevitable next one hits either.

I have, however, been increasingly disturbed by contingents of the vegan community embracing (wittingly or not) vivisectors and their vaccine industry. All hail vivisectors!? We’re now praying to the psychopathic gods of animal torture for our salvation? If we need a vivisector to harm a single animal to save a single one of us, then it’s all over. We as a community that alleges to advocate for animals has truly lost its way.

It’s probably been a long time coming. I’ve pretty much watched in disgust as the business models of welfarism and street theater have replaced activism. We’ve all seen the celebrated groups who see every suffering animal as an opportunity to collect donations. The groups whose marketing acumen has successfully equated staged profit-motivated law skirting with civil disobedience and gained a fawning following in the process. Those who wait for industrial abusers to extract their profits on their victims’ suffering and then swoop in to extract every last penny from their blood — either with self-enriching welfare violation “blockbusters,” donation solicitations for Queenie (a dog tortured to death in a Detroit lab almost a decade ago, her “advocates” protecting her tormentors from alleged radicals because those precise vivisectors are a necessity for them to continue to pad their bottom line), or staged open rescues. If we still need welfare investigations to figure out that animals suffer in labs and other cages, then we’re essentially useless. If we can mobilize hundreds of well-meaning but misguided activists to do photo ops with with a rescued victim but fail to throw our bodies on the machine to shut it down, then Animal Liberation is not the objective. The profit-motivated photo op is. How is this not obvious? What is glaring & painful to me is that we have way too many demagogues, frauds, and self-serving charlatans contaminating activism and leaving the animals on their own.

I opened this essay by discussing our complicity, but I’d never argue that smacking a burger out of someone’s mouth is effective action in the pursuit of our goal. I’d be doing it myself if I thought it would benefit the enslaved animal nations. Our ONLY job when it comes to animals & their abusers is to help the former and make the latter fear for their lives. A wholesale slaughter of vivisectors makes perfect strategic sense. Anyone who torments their restrained victims is nothing more than a coward who has a bright red target on his or her back. Start picking a few off and the rest will run for cover, hiding behind children and old ladies. They’re subhuman scum who’ve relinquished any right to consideration or comfort. So alleged activists waiting for these same cretins to poison and slaughter countless nonhumans in pursuit of a vaccine is something around which I cannot wrap my mind. I remember Walter Bond telling me probably a decade ago that “we can’t rally the troops because we have no troops.” But have we simply dropped all pretenses in the midst of our “crisis” of human privilege and just switched sides? It’s an absolute embarrassing disgrace.

While some are comfortable with the 100-year plan, either to turn the world vegan or form alliances with other militant and radical social justice movements (we may have a few isolated militant or radical actors, but no one is ever going to mistake our “movement” for either), I posit that the animals don’t have the luxury to wait for us to outgrow speciesism and self-interest. Time, like academic musings or theoretical minutia, are functions of our human privilege that are foreign to those in desperate need of relief now. This second. We must grasp that our only job is to stop every single abuser we can and, in the process, save countless more victims than we could ever liberate otherwise.

If we’re too busy to organize focused local efforts designed to undermine exploiters and compromise their infrastructure, then the animals will continue to die. Symbolic actions, candles, and photo ops might be profitable, but they stop no one. Those of us who haven’t been contaminated by mainstream welfarism and social media recipe cliques need to embrace our own radical ideas and trace a new trajectory for those who will follow. Arbitrary acts carried out by sequential individuals can have a significant impact– knock on a vivisector’s door and cough in their face before covid disappears, we haven’t had a good car bombing in a while, send their kids a present in the mail while they’re all being home schooled, they all have neighbors who’d appreciate a nice mass mailing. Or simply do what we know is just — a life for a life. The second one of these miscreants or their spawn comes to harm is the second we become an actual threat. (Edit: May 20 – Since I wrote this almost two months ago, we’ve seen armed militias and right-wing actors showing up at govt buildings in aggressive protests. I’ve wondered when we’ll see Animal Liberation activists follow suit and start showing up at the homes of vivisectors and other deserving abusers with our own weapons. Then I remembered, most of my colleagues are too busy hiding under a table waiting for the gods of vivisection to torture enough animals to death to make their world safe. My disillusion is palpable.)

And since we’ve failed miserably, let’s thank the pandemics for stepping in and maybe doing that of which we appear incapable for now — thinning out the most dangerous & malignant predator species to walk the face of the earth. Unfortunately, initial antibody testing indicates covid’s only got around a .1 to .3% mortality rate, comparable to the seasonal flu. But I have faith in the next pandemic my species continues to court. And I look forward to you all walking around in your designer hazmat suits next time around. I’m sure those selfies will replace the cutsie mask ones eventually.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrorist,"As of this writing, almost 2 million humans have been infected in the Covid-19 Coronavirus pandemic, and well over 100,000 have died as a result. Even so, although the true numbers are unknown, only a fraction of a percent of all humans have been sickened, and less than 6% of those infected have died. The majority of the 7.7 billion humans wrecking havoc on our planet and torturing and murdering hundreds of billions of non-human animals annually are continuing to go about their evil business as usual. If one believes, as we do, that humans are the real virus infecting planet earth, we can only bemoan the fact that so many humans will likely remain viable throughout the current pandemic.

The source of the current pandemic of Covid-19 is believed to be a “wet market” in Wuhan, China. In a wet market, all kinds of animals, live and dead, are for sale for consumption, many of them still alive in cages, many killed on the spot. The virus is believed to have originated in bats before moving to an intermediary animal widely consumed by humans after sale in these markets.

These markets contain fish packed into shallow tubs that splash water all over the floor. The floors and counter tops of stalls are slick and red with the blood of animals killed, skinned and gutted as customers watch. Live turtles and crustaceans climb over each other in desperate bids to escape filthy plastic boxes. Birds and mammals scream as they are killed; sick and wounded animals crammed into small cages stacked high drip blood, pus, feces, and urine onto other animals in cages below. In the eyes of all of them there is misery and terror. Water, blood, fish scales and animal guts are everywhere. Melting ice adds to the slush on the floor.

For years, scientists have warned that filthy markets crammed full of sick animals are breeding grounds for new, antibiotic-resistant “superbugs.” Some studies claim that by 2050, more people will be dying from these infectious diseases than from cancer. What the world is witnessing in horror in 2020 will someday be common. The United Nations has found that 70% of new human diseases, such as HIV(chimpanzees), Mad Cow Disease, Avian Flu(birds), Ebola(bats) and Swine Flu(pigs) were directly linked to animals used for food.

Amid the Coronavirus pandemic, we continue to be stunned by the lack of serious reporting on the source of the problem. Finally, after weeks of sparse coverage, we are beginning to see the issue come to light through figures that have captured the world’s attention, like Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who stated that “It boggles my mind how when we have so many diseases that emanate out of that unusual human-animal interface [wet markets], that we don’t just shut it down. I don’t know what else has to happen to get us to appreciate that.”

The writing has been on the wall for years. Animal agriculture, in all of its manifestations — from the disembowelment of pigs, slaughter of cows, killing of chickens on assembly lines, to the bloodthirsty “sport” of hunting — is a ticking time bomb. And its not only, or even primarily, infectious agents that are doing the killing. Heart disease and stroke, also the direct result of a flesh-based diet, kill 18 million people worldwide each and every year. We humans have a “vaccine” (a plant-based diet) for this major killer and yet knowingly fail to utilize it.

Unless humans change the way they live with animals, no amount of soap and hand sanitizer, social distancing or ventilators is going to save them as a species. Maybe that’s a good thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrorist,"Greta Thunberg, a young environmental activist, has become a powerful icon in our popular culture. Time magazine named her the 2019 “person of the year.” Many governments and business leaders, including Trump, have lashed out at her activism, and even her personally.

Concern regarding climate change and other environmental issues is clearly growing, particularly in North America. Part of this interest can be reflected in the current movement toward veganism, based on both environmental concerns and an embrace of “animal liberation” in general. Others have adopted an entirely plant-based (vegan) diet for reasons of weight loss and personal health and well-being goals.

How should Marxists respond to the arguments in favor of animal liberation? What position should we take on the growing thought that animals should not be used for agricultural purposes?  Is there a way for us to address this movement in a serious way? A failure to address animal liberation could lead to the perception that Marxists don’t really care about environmental issues, and perhaps to an extent that perception is correct!

It should be noted at the outset that veganism in itself is politically neutral. In their book Vegan Freak: Being Vegan in a Non-Vegan World (2010), Bob and Jenna Torres point out that veganism has representation from every political system of belief on the planet. We can note that Adolf Hitler was a vegan! His veganism was based on a Nazi concept of the purification of the body. We certainly should not dismiss the movement based on his conception of purity! What makes veganism a concept worth exploring is precisely the way that the movement addresses core political issues such as class, exploitation, and alienation.

To begin, we should note that some communists have written off the vegan approach as being liberal or bourgeois in its origins. That is a reasonable response to the narratives currently employed by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). That organization is the most vocal vegan organization in the West. Many may appreciate their videos or online posts about the importance of stopping animal cruelty. Marxists can certainly agree that measures could reasonably be taken to stop needless suffering.

For most of us, however, that’s where the agreement stops. PETA has acted in ways that have, rightly, been condemned as “environmental racism.” Activists such as Pamela Anderson have famously fought against the seal hunt. Attacks on the seal hunt can lead to a racist and imperialist approach which attacks the traditional practices of Indigenous peoples around the world, particularly those based on hunter-gatherer economies. It is very hard to imagine that those living in far-north Arctic regions will be able to find their protein source from plants. Eating seal and caribou are essential to the provision of protein in their diet.

Approaches based on PETA have also focused on personal responsibility and the practice of “ethical consumption.” It has long been held that individual consumers should personally adopt a vegan lifestyle in order to personally stop the exploitation of animals by the agricultural sector. Within a capitalist framework, just how are our personal eating habits going to change capitalist industry?

We also need to explore the fact that when a product has been labelled “vegan” it can literally be sold at triple the price. Most working-class and poor families cannot afford to have their grocery bill tripled. As a result, many workers have ruled out living a vegan lifestyle. To take the argument seriously, however, we need to acknowledge that it doesn’t have to be this way. The vegan diet is typically made of fruits, vegetables, grains and legumes. There is absolutely no reason for such food items to be more expensive than meat, dairy, eggs or honey. Corporations have co-opted veganism by making “vegan” products so expensive. We need to challenge that!

We should also pay attention to the fact that, in India in particular, Hindu nationalism has been used to oppress Muslim people. Many Hindus and Buddhists around the world have embraced vegetarianism, and even veganism. What is concerning is the attack on those minority religious communities which traditionally have included meat consumption in their diet. Many vegans have criticized the practice of halal (or Muslim) meat production in which an animal’s throat is slit, similar to Jewish kosher meat production, calling it cruel. Arguments based on Islamophobic or anti-Semitic claims absolutely need to be rejected by anti-imperialist Marxists around the world.

Vegan Marxism?

Having explored the rejection of a liberal bourgeois argument, is it possible to adopt a vegan Marxist approach? Let’s take a look at a couple of issues which could form the basis for just such a position and practice.

Vegan Marxism needs to take, as its starting point, a solidarity with all workers who are currently employed in the field of animal agriculture. In North America, meat is extremely popular as a source of protein, and as a culinary enjoyment. Many of us retain fond memories of a family day in the summer around a barbecue! At the same time, most of us don’t really want to think about the fact that our meat that we love so much came from a sentient, caring and loving animal. As a result, those workers who are employed in slaughterhouses, meat packing plants, and butchery operations are typically workers at the very bottom of the ladder. In the U.S. in particular, it has been determined that workers in this field are over-represented by undocumented Mexican immigrants.

Several films on the Netflix platform such as Cowspiracy address this phenomenon. Major agricultural firms will employ such workers due to the fact that they can get away with paying these workers poorly. Vegan Marxists must take the material interests of such workers to heart.

Marxists who follow a vegan approach, and ecologists in general, often point out that animal-based agriculture is simply not sustainable. The amount of resources needed to produce a pound of meat, for instance, includes the feeding and grazing of cattle at a level of immense proportions. Animal-based agriculture is currently the largest industrial contributor to environmental destruction.

Take, for example, the deliberate burning of Amazon rainforests in Brazil to make way for cattle ranching. Beef and dairy production requires a massive amount of water and resources such as corn and soybeans, which could be used to feed people directly. Each year, the amount of cattle on the Earth increases far beyond the level that would occur by nature. Cattle used for dairy, for instance, are artificially inseminated so that they will become pregnant and give birth to calves. This is done in order for cattle to be able to lactate, and thereby produce milk. Those vegetarians who consume dairy, eggs, and honey are often quite saddened to learn that the calves produced in this way are typically diverted to veal production. Again, beef and dairy production demands more available land, which, under a capitalist framework, means the destruction of forests (the lungs of the Earth) and the loss of land previously held by Indigenous peoples around the world.

Vegan Marxists also really need to look at the fact that most people living largely on a plant-based diet do so on an involuntary basis. For most citizens of the world, meat is a luxury. For the environmental movement to be successful, all peoples of Earth must not only be considered as equals, but be treated as equals. In North America and Europe, meat and dairy production is heavily subsidized. Those subsidies reflect a decision, made socially, to value such production. It is very difficult to imagine that animal liberation or the ceasing of environmental degradation can be achieved under a capitalist framework. Under socialism, and ultimately, communism, social resources can be harnessed which are based on a more sustainable model of development.

It certainly is possible for Marxists to seriously address the environmental movement. A failure to do so could be dangerous, both for the socialist movement but also for our planet. It is also possible, and arguably necessary, for the environmental movement to seriously embrace an anti-racist, anti-capitalist, and anti-imperialist framework!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrorist,"From its editorial:  “a magazine for the radical anarchist, the animal liberationist and those who are willing to fight for a better world.”

Wildfire Magazine is a new animal liberation and anarchist magazine that covers direct action news, philosophy and theory and poractical adive and skills alongside a clean and neat design.

Terrorist,"As you know, one of the main tasks we do is to serve as an anonymous platform for folks who decide to take action but want to remain anonymous. Be it the liberation of animals from a p[lace of exploitation to the sabotage of infrastructure or tools used to abuse animals and the earth, Unoffensive receives reports from around the globe to be published anonymously.

With it, there is the question of how to send those reports securely. Whilst in reality, any form of internet communications is never 100% secure, folks can take steps so they are safer online in order to ensure they can keep working without the burden of prosecution by the law. In this post we want to briefly cover the ins and outs of report sending.

Let us start with the most basic of all. You should NOT send reports online over instagram or Facebook private message. It is not private and it is in fact very easy to track down. This might come as a surprise to many, but we have received reports over social media before, and we suspect it to still be a thing in the future. We do not want to know who you are, and if you do not want folks to know who took action, you should not be using insecure platforms. If, on the other hand, you want to publicise an open rescue, that is for you to choose, but we rarely platform that kind of action as it already carries traction in other social media groups.

So how do you actually send a report? We have an exhaustive explanation on our website under the “Contact Us” tab, but we can quickly explain over here. There are two main methods that you can chose from, one being the form within our website and the other one, using a spam email address. Regardless, both of them require a couple of steps before you do any sending.

The first step would be to connect to a VPN. VPN serves as a mask between your computer and the Internet Service Provider. Instead of you asking the questions to the Internet provider, you tell the VPN to ask those questions for you. You NEED to understand that using solely a VPN does not equate to being secure, anonymous or private online. In this case, we only need the VPN to not let your internet service know you are connected to a TOR network (we will explain this shortly!). You can download and use very intuitively RiseUp VPN or ProtonVPN.

Once you are connected to a VPN, you want to open TOR. TOR is like any other internet browser, but it uses multiple jumps (or nodes) to go from the request to the answer. For that reason, it is a lot more difficult to track down your internet activity. It also comes packed with tools that help with privacy and don’t let websites spy on your behaviour. You can download and install TOR (for free!!) in torproject.org

Once you have connected to a VPN and opened TOR, you have two choices. One is to simply fill the form in our contact us and click send. We have it configured so that it is encrypted and only us holding the private key are able to understand the language of the email.

If you do not want to fill up that form, you can instead use a spam email address (never your personal address!) to send a report. You can go to any spam email service like tempr.email, which creates a disposable address without any details where you can compose an email and send it to unoffensiveanimal(at)riseup(dot)net.

If you need to send media (photos or video) you should be aware of metadata. You can read more about it on our website. Once you got rid of metadata, you can simply attach it (whilst still using TOR and a VPN) to any file sharing service (like WeTransfer, also free) and then paste the link to download the files in the same email as the report.

The report should not include any personal details or anything that can give away your identity. We don’t need to know, and we (almost always) simply copy and paste the report without any editing. Be mindful about what you are writing.

It is as simple as that! You can read more about it on our website www.unoffensiveanimal.is/contact-us

Terrorist,"Press Officer Gregston Van Pukeston’s home was visited by the FBI on Wednesday, November 4 at around 11:45 am. 2 men rang the door bell at Van Pukeston’s home in New Paltz, NY, where they were summarily rebuffed.

Not allowed inside, they were asked who they were and what they wanted. One agent said, “hello, we are looking for Gregston Van Pukeston”. The agent Identified himself as an agent with the FBI, ( he flashed a badge that did not resemble typical FBI badge).

He asked the person who opened the door if they were Gregston Van Pukeston; the person replied , “I’m not answering that question”. They agent then said , “that’s fine, the reason for our visit is we wanted to reach out to Gregston because of him being a Press Officer with NAALPO and were told NAALPO is a very reputable news outlet for the animal rights movement. We wanted to ask if Gregston would be willing to work with law enforcement as a laiason to the local animal rights movement with law enforcement.”

The Agent continued “I don’t know much about the animal rights movement and we were hoping Gregston would be willing to (kind) of explain the groups and movement to me. We want to kind of be ( peace keepers) with the movement and keep ” extremists ” from infiltrating the ranks of Animal Rights Groups.”

He asked if Gregston, ” would you be willing to be a laiason and work with law enforcement for these reasons.” Resident responded “Sorry, I don’t answer questions, and I don’t work with law enforcement”

The Agent replied, ” Yeah, we figured that. There is a lot of mistrust and suspicion with law enforcement in the animal rights and activist communities in general. That’s why we are reaching out hoping we could try to bridge that gap”.

Resident Answered “Please do not come back here.” Agent thanked resident for his time and wished him a good day.

During the time of this conversation, 2nd Agent stood on road with arms crossed. Both Agents wore Covid face masks to cover their faces. Both were white males, early 30s,  tall, 5’11 possibly. They refused to give their names or supply a business card, and no vehicle was identified.

[Press Office note: If you are ever confronted by law enforcement at your residence, follow these simple rules:
1. Never allow them into your residence, unless they produce a valid warrant.
2. Never agree to cooperate, and better still, tell them only to go away.
3. If possible, get a photo, name or business card and a photo of their vehicle, in order to alert other activists.
4. You do NOT have to answer any questions they proffer, and indeed, should not do so, no matter how mundane the questions may seem.
5. They are LESS likely to ever bother you again if they know you are completely uncooperative.
6. They cannot hurt you as long as you give them nothing.
7. Agents can and do lie routinely. If their lips are moving, they are likely lying. They do NOT want to be your friend or help you or the animal liberation movement.]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terrorist,"EDWARDS: Well as to just how much now... it would be hard to estimate. But the Ku Klux Klan itself is an organization here to stay.

EDWARDS: No... no... they do not.
EDWARDS: Well they do -- they respect the Klan for the principles of which it stands.

EDWARDS: Well, the Klan is respected as of now, and at the speed the Klan is growing and organizing today, then it will gain the respect of the people of the United States.

EDWARDS: I only account for that is that being propaganda sheet material.

EDWARDS: That material there is. Now I recall the incident in Alabama, they refer to three Klansmen there. Well they would come nearer being three thousand than there were three. And that was a prelude to an outing there that same night, a cross-burning, an outing of the Klan itself, a rally so to speak.


EDWARDS: Well, for the same reason, Mike, I don't understand how they arrive at a number... an estimated membership there of fifty-thousand or a hundred-thousand...I don't know how they arrive at that.

EDWARDS: And no one has that information but me... I do not divulge it.

EDWARDS: Well... it's part of the secret of the organization. It is a secret fraternal order, you know.



EDWARDS: I do.



EDWARDS: Very much so.



EDWARDS: Sure...


EDWARDS: Well, you must understand for each member of this organization, there will be ten to twelve sympathizers and for various reason they might not belong. They might not become active members.



EDWARDS: Well, for domestic reasons, several different reasons, of course.


EDWARDS: Well, that makes him the joke hisself. That makes the Governor the joke, for making a statement like it, if he made that statement now. Don't get me wrong. I don't believe anything Mullinhof would say anymore after the story in Look magazine.


EDWARDS: It's a fake and a phoney.

EDWARDS: It is.

EDWARDS: I agree there.

EDWARDS: It does.



EDWARDS: Yes.


EDWARDS: Well, that's evidence there that he didn't know anything about what he was talking about when he mentioned the violence in there. He was mostly wrong there, now, you must remember too there's a distinction between a preacher and a supposed-to-be preacher. And there's a distinction between a man that knows what this organization is and a man that doesn't know.

WALLACE: Are you suggesting the Rev. Thomas Holmes of the First Baptist Church of College Park is not a preacher... is not a responsible...

EDWARDS: He doesn't know what he's talking about.

WALLACE: Do you know the man?

EDWARDS: No...I don't know him.

WALLACE: Do you know the Rev. 0. Norman Shanz?

EDWARDS: No... I do not.

WALLACE: Tell me this, Mr, Edwards, this probably is the nub of the problem in a good many people's minds... what will the Klan do when the Supreme Court decision on desegregation in public schools is carried through say in Alabama or in Georgia. Is it your plan to oppose it by violence?

EDWARDS: No... it is not. This organization does not go in for violence... in no respect.

WALLACE: You are not involved and never have been nor do you want violence.

EDWARDS: Never will be.

WALLACE: I see... Well... what is your plan then?

EDWARDS: Well this plan is to fight the thing morally.

WALLACE: How do you fight it morally?

EDWARDS: It's a moral condition there -- desegregation is. God Almighty created the races and segregated them...sent them each on their own destiny.

WALLACE: Where do you find that information, sir?

EDWARDS: In Exodus 27 Verse 26...I believe it is.

WALLACE: I'm not suggesting that you can quote it... book, chapter and verse to me but what does the God Almighty say about the segregation of the races? In Exodus...what?

EDWARDS: I believe 26...27 -Verse 26.

WALLACE: What is the substance of what He says...

EDWARDS: Well...just right off I couldn't quote it to you.

WALLACE: But you do have the book, chapter and verse...

EDWARDS: Oh, yes...

WALLACE: But you're unable to quote the...

EDWARDS: In other words, if you read the Bible from lid to lid it preaches and teaches segregation. He created the fowl of the air. He created the fish of the sea. He created the animals. He created the man. He all... He sent them all on a separate...

WALLACE: And you believe then, therefore, from the Scripture that segregation is handed down by Scripture's laws.

EDWARDS: Sure.

WALLACE: And, therefore, when your Baptist ministers from your own hometown suggest that the attitude of the Klan in that respect is wrong. They're wrong -- they're interpreting the Scripture incorrectly.

EDWARDS: I regret to say that they're not my Baptist ministers. My Baptist minister upholds the God's law... the God's word...

WALLACE: You say...

EDWARDS: The teaching of the book...

WALLACE: Mr. Edwards, you say that the Klan rejects violence?

EDWARDS: It does.

EDWARDS: Well...I didn't hear him say that.

WALLACE: You think that it's possible that he may have said that?

EDWARDS: I doubt that.

WALLACE: Mr. Mullinhof and Mr. Neville suggest that he said it...not once...

EDWARDS: I don't believe anything that one of those birds said on it

WALLACE: Will you believe your own papers from down South?

EDWARDS: No...I do not.

WALLACE: You don't believe your own papers?

EDWARDS: The news papers?

WALLACE: Yes.

EDWARDS: Christ, no.


EDWARDS: I don't know anything about the last one now, but the first one in Camden, South Carolina, there was not a Klanman involved there.

WALLACE: You know this for a fact?

EDWARDS: I do know that for a fact. Had there been a Klansman involved there, he wouldn't have been a Klanman any longer.


EDWARDS: Let me set him straight there on one thing: This organization here itself -- and I refer to it as a protestant faith organization has been denied freedom of the press. We do not have freedom of the press. We are completely denied freedom of the press...and anything you read in any of the major papers... is mere propaganda... and not the true facts.

WALLACE: You say you don't have freedom of the press, Mr. Edwards and yet these are Southern people, a good many of them, who believe in segregation...believe in it sensibly and whole-heartedly. And their aims then are the same as your aims...why then won't they grant you, who have the same aims as they do, freedom of the press?

EDWARDS: Well...the smaller press does. The smaller papers. The weekly papers and things of that nature.

WALLACE: Well, who controls the dailies and why won't they grant you freedom of the press?

EDWARDS: Well, it is a controlled press...you well understand that.

WALLACE: Controlled by whom?

EDWARDS: Well...we had some presses where they were giving us fair publicity- stop all at once, you go ask them why. They tell you right quick pressure was put on them.

WALLACE: Pressure by whom?

EDWARDS: Well...we won't go into that at this time.

WALLACE: Why not?

EDWARDS: Well...the Anti-Defamation League.

WALLACE: Pressure by the Anti-Defamation League?

EDWARDS: Right.

WALLACE: For what reason? How can they put pressure on...

EDWARDS: Put them out of business.

WALLACE: How can a newspaper down there, like the Atlanta Constitution or the Birmingham paper. How can they put them out of business?

EDWARDS: You must remember that this Atlanta Constitution and the Atlanta Journal there is owned by Cox in Ohio and it's financed and supported by the business of Atlanta. And then it's edited and published by the NAACP.

WALLACE: The NAACP edits and publishes the...

EDWARDS: Well... verbally speaking.

WALLACE: The NAACP edits and publishes the Atlanta Constitution.

EDWARDS: Well, they're more or less behind the editing and publishing of it that's what I mean.

WALLACE: What do you think of the NAACP, sir?

EDWARDS: Well, I don't think much of it.

WALLACE: What's wrong with it?

EDWARDS: Well, I've never found anything good about it.

WALLACE: Well, what...but specifically, what's wrong?

EDWARDS: Well, its... I think, commonly known that it's a foreign inspired organization from start to finish.

WALLACE: Foreign inspired?

EDWARDS: Yes.

WALLACE: Foreign dominated dominated by what foreign country?

EDWARDS: Well...it has a communistic leanings.

WALLACE: The NAACP has communistic leanings.

EDWARDS: That's right.

WALLACE: Foreign inspired and foreign dominated.

EDWARDS: I think that's pretty much established.


EDWARDS: I agree.

WALLACE: Head of the F. B. I.?

EDWARDS: Right.



EDWARDS: I don't have the list at hand...here...I could give you the names and the citations of Communistic activities -- Communist affiliations of the officers...not all the officers but a majority of the officers of the NAACP.

WALLACE: Then J. Edgar Hoover has been taken in. He is a dupe.

EDWARDS: No...J. Edgar Hoover hasn't been taken in... he knows what's going on in this country.

WALLACE: Why in the world would he make a statement like that then, sir?

EDWARDS: Well, maybe he made it, maybe he didn't. I don't know.

WALLACE: He made it, believe me. In one piece of Klan literature that you furnished us it is charged... quote...""One drop of Negro blood in your family destroys your white blood forever"". I take it that you believe that.

EDWARDS: Well, I wouldn't, I wouldn't define it down to one drop... now. But here it stands to reason as common sense, that Mongolization means destruction...it means the destruction of the white race...it means the destruction of the Nigger race.

EDWARDS: I sure will believe in segregation for the simple reason we believe in preserving and protecting God's word. He created the white man. He intended for him to stay white. He created the nigger. He intended for him to stay black. And we believe that Mongolization destroys both races and creates a Mongol which is not a race.

WALLACE: You do believe then, a mixing of the blood of Negro and white, will lead to the downfall of the white race and of the Negro.

EDWARDS: That's right. And eventually the destruction of this country.

WALLACE: Well, I'm sure that a good many Klan members, whether in the Armed Forces during the Korean War or the Second World War, Mr. Edwards, and that some of them were wounded and needed blood transfusions. We were told last Friday by Col. Bryant Fenton, Executive Officer to the Office of the Army Surgeon-General that quote"" Blood segregation is not practiced in the Army Medical Corps.""

WALLACE: In other words, some of your Klansmen probably have Negro blood in their veins, a fair amount of it right now, as a result of transfusions that they received in the Army. By those circumstances, under those conditions, does that mean that they are not white men any longer?

EDWARDS: Well, it could show up in the offspring.

WALLACE: Do you know this to be a medical fact, sir, or is this a mind...

EDWARDS: Well, you have conflicting reports there from the medical side of this thing. Some of them will go along with it. Some of them will not.

WALLACE: What political power, if any, does the Klan wield and where? What important politicians do you influence, or believe in you?

EDWARDS: I'd like to put this over. This is not a political organization.

WALLACE: I know... but there...

EDWARDS: By no means whatsoever.

WALLACE: What political people, for instance in Georgia, are sympathetic to the Klan and its aims? And its methods? The Governor of Georgia?

EDWARDS: Well, we're fortunate to have a government in the state of Georgia, I'll put it that way, we do have a state government in the state of Georgia... some states do not have...

WALLACE: The Governor of Georgia is on your side then?

EDWARDS: Well now... I wouldn't put it that strenuous... The Governor, may I say, is a good Governor.


EDWARDS: Who said that?

WALLACE: A spokesman for Sen. Herman Talmadge.

EDWARDS: I don't think he was a spokesman for Herman Talmadge.

WALLACE: We talked to this man in Sen. Talmadge's office several weeks ago.

EDWARDS: I would like to put it this way that Klan-ish minded people sent Herman Talmadge to the office he holds. Also the Klan-ish minded people sent Marvin Griffin to the office he holds.

WALLACE: Let me ask you this, sir. I have here a statement in the official Communist newspaper in the Soviet Union -- Pravda, September 10, 1956.I wonder if you'd listen to it and then answer me out of your heart how you feel about it?

WALLACE: Quote from Pravda: ""How can one measure the bitter cup of humiliation and suffering from which the Negro people in the United States have been forced to drink at schools, in buses and trains everywhere. There are restrictions on Negroes imposed by the whites alone.

WALLACE: There is the much praised democracy and freedom for you. It is this democracy which Washington, D. C. is trying to export."" Now, sir, what is your reaction when your avowed enemy Communism -- grinds out anti-American propaganda based on the actions of the Ku Klux Klan?

EDWARDS: Well, I don't care to even answer a bunch of skunks of that nature, in the first place. But I would like to just make this one statement that if just such elements of death would leave the Negro alone in this country over here. For eighty-five years we have gotten along with the black race in this country. For eighty-five years we have raised the Negro up from you might say slavery to where he is today. 

EDWARDS: We have educated the Negro. In my home state down there, the nigger faced 3% of the tax. He draws three dollars to every one dollar for the white, right back. That in my home state alone. And then this element of that nature over there... pushing the Negro around... kicking him... using him for a tool... and the nigger himself don't know that.

WALLACE: What do you want to do for the Negro, you of the Klan?

EDWARDS: The same thing that the white people has done for the last eighty-five years: continue to help the nigger, support the nigger, give him his education, pay his schools, pay his teachers...

EDWARDS: Sure.

EDWARDS: Well, the Supreme Court in that decision tore down a pattern, a pattern that had been set for eighty...some seventy-eight years. Three different decisions was handed down and in this decision here the word equal was substitute for the same, well equal and same is two different words.

EDWARDS: I disagree.
EDWARDS: I have been asked a question; was this organization confined to the South. No, it definitely is not and it is operating in Northern states.

EDWARDS: Yes. I'm looking for a Grand Dragon, how about you? You would make a pretty good one.

EDWARDS: It's been a pleasure to be here, Mike.

Terrorist,"There are politicians in Washington D.C. working around the clock chipping away at our liberty, but thanks to the foresight of our founding fathers America has held out the longest against the global, race mixing, homosexual, anti-Christ forces working to wipe out White Christianity the way we have always known it. The Mexican birthrate in this country is five times that of white people. The black birthrate is four times larger. America will become a Third World nation if these trends continue. Unless we slow down and cut off immigration by beefing up border control and encourage welfare recipients to have fewer kids, the white population in America will be swamped. Fear of the Klan will never win our people over but rekindling the love for their heritage will — and love of heritage is what we want. Love of Race, Love of Nation, Love of Faith.

Terrorist,"Racial idealism, or racialism, is the idea that a nation's greatest resource is the quality of its people. It means examining all questions of government on the basis of whether the proposed measure is good or bad for our race. … Neither Communism, Capitalism, nor any other materialistic doctrine can save our race; our only racial salvation lies in a White racial alliance uniting our people with the common cause of racial idealism. When it's America's time to go totalitarian, we should pray that we get a Kemal [Ataturk, former president of Turkey who modernized that country in the 1900s], who was more aware than any other great public figure of modern times that national resurrection depends first and foremost on the distillation process of racial separation. In modern America, Jews lead the effort to de-Christianize America. ... They share little of the heritage of the Old Testament people called the Israelites. … Communism and Zionism were born from the same Jewish soul. ... Jewish power is ubiquitous. ... It is not a [Jewish] conspiracy. It is simply two nations — Jew and Gentile — in a state of ethnic war. Israel makes the Nazi state look very, very moderate. Are facts racist too? Are white parents racist because they don’t want their children to go to school where their children are ten times more likely to be robbed or abused, intimidated, beaten, or even killed or raped? A school where obscenity, drugs and violence and gangster rap are the dominant culture? Where sexual intimidation, obscene or crude language, or even sexual assault is pervasive? Schools that academically resemble more the third world than America? I know some of you don’t worry about the white children in those environments. It’s considered noble to concern yourself with the well being of minorities even at the farthest ends of the earth. But if you’re white, and you concern yourself with the well being of your own people, even of your own children, you’re deemed racist.

Terrorist,"There was a fight at high school between a black kid and a white kid and everyone was supporting the black kid who had been picking on this white forever. Typical bullshit, right? But we knew that there were Whites there who were sick and tired of being called “racists” just for sticking up for themselves. So we went down there one day, right, when school was letting out and beat the shit out of some gangster-looking nigger. The next day everyone at Milwaukee was talking about, “Oh man, did you hear aout the skinehads kicked some nigger’s ass?” It was the talk of the school so we went back a week later and put up a bunch of flyers and got a bunch of class from kids wanting know what they could do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All it takes is one spic to start something and we just open a can of whoop-ass. It’s great for us because we know that half the White kids there are getting harassed by the Hispanics in their school and they are just waiting for someone to stick up for them. I’ve had these totally straight looking kids come up to me later, maybe a month later, and say, “hey, that was really cool what you did. I wish you guys would come to my school and kick some ass.” It’s like a commercial for Youth Corps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrorist,"The easiest place to recruit is around some big layoff, which is pretty common around here. You wait for things to get bad and you go talk to the kids, not the parents and say, “You know why your dad got laid off? IT’s because th money hungry Jews sent his job to CHina. They care more about the fucking Chinese than they do about the White workers”. You know, they’re all fucked up because their world is upside down and here is someone explaining it to them in very simple terms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I mean, Whites moved out here to get away from all the crime and niggers and shit and here they come. And now we have gangs out here and drugs and these nice clean White kids gettin’ jumped. Weknow that White parents are tired of moving and White teachers are scared to death and the young people are on the front line. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrorist,"The feminists are as bad as the queers are. We try to get our guys to talk to dudes who think feminism is cool. You know, they’re into it because they think they’ll get laid. But we say, “Hey, you know what happens if the feminists get their way? No one’s gonna listen to you because you’re a man and you’re gonna be cleaning out the toilet. And even fewer White babies are gonna be born because if a chick has sex with you and gets pregnant she’s gonna have an abortion so she can keep her paycheck. Do you think the niggers and the Mexicans are having abortions? Hell no!” So then they see feminism as the nail in the coffin. It’s like, who wants to be a minority? I’ll tell ya, as much as I hate all this “Gay Pride” shit, it’s been the best thing for skinheads. Our numbers have tripled since they’ve been having these rallies in Cobb.

They bitch and moan and you say, “Yeah it was a lot better in my day when we didn’t have gangs and people who can’t even speak English and all this multicultural shit” I’d say, “don’t you think it’s fucked up that you can have a Black student union but not a White student union? Why are the Blacks allowed to be racist? And you can see them agreeing. I say, Did you ever own a slave? Did you ever kill an indian? So why are they trying to make you feel guilty for being White? Before they can answer I’d start telling them about ZOG. About how the Jews are behind all this to fuck over the White man. I give them the whole line, multiculturalism, gay rights, affirmative action. These kids don’t know shit so they just eat it up. Then I tell them they should hang out with us or start an “unofficial” White student club. They just look at me like I’m Jesus Christ and I just saved them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terrorist," Very bad. Very bad. No arms, very little. No training. A few hundred people and for years no contact for weapons. Bad leadership, bad policies. Well, a slogan on the walls--IRA, we run away--very unfair to volunteers. They fight sometimes [with] their hands. But they fought with the leadership in Dublin.Well, I told you, right. But they want to reorganize and they're worried about more attacks. A lot of people come back to the movement and particularly the auxiliary unitsI didn't want to see a split in Belfast, but it was too late. Some of the staff in Belfast were sympath[etic] to Goldings proposals and so that was too late.Reasons. One was political, and the other was military, they had this... Ideological and also Republicans want to abolish Stormont. I walked to the microphone, and said, ""I pledge my allegiance to the provisional IRA."" These were people who tied themselves to their Irish Republican Army. Then I said, ""Now ... it's time to go. Go."" And we did.Born, no, that's Sinn Fein. Three weeks before the IRA.We sent orders to all units in the south. I want 90% of your weapons and money for the units in the north ... and we had no training courses, HQ and everything like that. First, defense for the summer. All weapons and ammunition and equipment for Belfast, Derry and the other places, because the summer is always trouble. So we thought, right and plenty of training, and reorganization, that's it.After internment. Before, anything else was a retaliation, because the British army was bad to the people. So we thought retaliatory action and sabotage. But after internment we went to all offensive, all offensive action.No. It was on retaliation for the bad treatment of British troops in Belfast.The British people say if you stay in Ireland there's a price to pay.More soldiers go back in coffins unless the pressure the government to right thing about Ireland.  Good now. When 1972 good, very good, I think, the best and better IRA for fifty years, more men, ammunition equipment and very, very good morale. And we reorganized everything.Yes. But there was a report that the British army said we give us a month in Belfast, one Derry, and then two months in the border, its over. Well, they were wrong.He was a potential leader. Good thinker. And good in the national question.He was in leadership ... Belfast.In Republican movement.Well, I sent a messenger from Derry and explaining the thing, then that night I rang to Gerry and I said ""Oh I'm very, very ... surprised, ... and you owe me one.He says, No, I tell 'em get, collect and in a couple of days and leave, right. His wife.They scout out the roads, and escort, right. Yes. Yes. And O'Connell was as well ... we had a driver and two others and another car.Yes. And once I went to Derry, to the funeral, Sean Keenan's son was killed. And they advice was too much activity the British army in their droves, so I said, ""You take me over the fields in Derry."" We did.Well ... one Seamus Toomey. O'Connell, Martin McGuinness, and myself and Adams from the prisoners.Yes. ... And I said and so that's it, .... I want this an IRA ...Well he come to me and said, ""Mr. MacStiofain, how do you do?"" I [thought] this guy has done his homework because he pronounced my name perfect. I said, ""I'm OK, now this is my friend Seamus Toomey, .... O'Connell, Martin McGuinness, Adams, Bell."" So he said, ""Oh, Mr. O'Connell, perhaps you want to sit down to me."" [He] said ""No, we sit down as group.""No, no. And a long, a line of us right. ""I think I will begin."" Yes. ""But we have a constitution guarantee for the unionists,"" I said. ""It's a fact that one act of parliament can put back the other one."" He said, ""Oh that's a fact of parliamentary life."" So then we would talk about the incident in ... nationalist people in rural …Right, and Whitelaw said, ""Oh, British troops will never fire on civilians."" So I said, ""Martin, you have something to say?"" ""Yes, Mr. Whitelaw, I saw your troops, paras, kill people in Derry, they were unarmed civilians."" So I said and others. So no reply from Whitelaw and the staff much muttering, ""No capital alliance.""We want a couple of years, four years ... to withdraw. We want the withdrawal first of January 1975. that was negotiations. Well, political, yes, as well. Yes. Because no, we want all military and political withdrawal. No. But we said, ""Give them a week at the most, but start three days."" No, but you see, if he first said, ""No,"" [we] were [to] give them more time ... another couple of days, then we said, ""One week,"" because I knew that a Cabinet meeting on the Thursday, so I said, ""Whitelaw, OK, that's it, but if there was in the chance to more negotiations right, we can expand that."" But I don't think they were interested.Steele come to me and said, ""Don't tell me you're not starting, your stupid campaign again."" So I said, ""Well, it's up to you people. We never worried about the casualties, we've more casualties in Germany with accidents ... you lost twenty men in two weeks in here, in Ireland."" ""You know what they mean."" And I said, ""Well that's about the troops."" But the British and the UDA broke the bloody truce. No, that is wrong. No ... but I had people I respect there that told you that that's not so. No, that the UDA went into break the truce and the British army in Belfast the British general, brigadier they want to break the truce. No, they, lots of incidents as well in Belfast, Portadown and ... the truce had gone by Sunday night. Well, the leadership first of all units in the north were instructions to get back to operations. And I said the campaign will be stop. Well the leadership had an order to all units in the north, get back into offensive action and we must get intensify the campaign. It was, 22 in Belfast and 14 other parts right, and only two had civilian casualties, and the every bomb had three warnings and the British government and the British army they not give the warnings. No. Nine people were killed then. Two British army, two RUC, one a known RU and a UDA. But there were four innocent people and we regretted all of them. The others were legitimate targets. They were, yes, and we regretted all of them, but the blame was the people who deliberately not given the warnings to the public. No, I don't agree. Oh, well, but if the British government has persistent his policies to the north of Ireland, then you get resistance and I'm sure if the same situation was England, some of your friends would resist it. es. Yes. We have and there was planned an operation to sabotage the factory [that] makes CS gas in 1970, but I then the OC was bad in security and four people were arrested. Right. So then another year an operation was organized for shooting a high ranking officer, who was not, was in the north. But then we had two operations planned for the end of 72, and I was arrested so I don't know what happened, but yes. To make sure that the establishment would see that they must pay dearly for the north of Ireland. And the policies and the prison. I was very, very disappointed, very disappointed. And that was one of the biggest mistakes that Adams made and so yes. The government in Dublin is typical neo-colonial government ... there's no real policy about the north. And saying from the people, whole people here ... went into politics to advance the class interest, his own class.  I was pleased. Four years before I suggested to the IRA leadership that something like that to suspend offensive action and change the tactics. No. No, I do not. Because Major and the unionists have never taken the peace process seriously
